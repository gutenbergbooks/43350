<div class="transnote"><p><b>Transcriber&rsquo;s notes</b>:</p>

<p>In this transcription, hyperlinking has been applied to page references,
as well as references to illustrations and footnotes. Hyperlinks are
indicated by black dotted underlines (plus aqua highlighting when the
mouse pointer hovers over them). Page numbers are shown in the right
margin. The footnotes, which are located at the end of the book, are
themselves hyperlinked back to the originating marker to facilitate easy
return to the text. A red dashed underline indicates the presence of a
transcriber&rsquo;s comment; scrolling the mouse pointer over such text
will reveal the comment.</p>

<p><b>Errors and inconsistencies</b>:<br />
The text contains numerous inconsistencies of hyphenation. A few have
been adjusted where there was clear evidence of a preferred style (e.g.
meso-colic-->mesocolic and meso-duodenum-->mesoduodenum) but most have
been left in their original format.</p>

<p>A few spelling typos have been corrected silently (e.g.
improtant-->important, mecocolon-->mesocolon) and missing letters have
been inserted inside square brackets (e.g. junct[i]on, t[r]ansverse).
Some spelling inconsistencies possibly represent contemporarily
acceptable spelling alternatives (e.g. coati/coaiti, mesal/mesial,
præcava/precava, hyæna/hyena). The term STOMADÆUM is incorrectly spelt
as STOMADŒUM in Figs. 27 and 101, and Fig. 250 has an incorrect label on
the R. vitelline vein.</p>

<p>A small number of punctuation inconsistencies have been corrected
silently by insertion of missing punctuation or deletion of redundant
punctuation.</p>

<p>The abbreviation viz. appears inconsistently in both roman and italic
font.</p>

<p><b>Illustrations</b>:<br />
The book contains 582 variously-sized illustrations that were originally
clustered into 300 plates dispersed in groups throughout the book. Scans
of the images were irregularly discoloured, unevenly illuminated and
varied in their size and resolution. Except for the largest images,
which have been reduced, their relative sizes have been retained and the
cleaned up images have been relocated close to their relevant mention in
the text. Their number and varied size posed challenges for creating a
layout that could be viewed and read comfortably &ndash; a browser width
of 1000-1100 pixels is optimal, and some browsers display them more
clearly than others. Sharp-eyed readers will note that references in the
text to image labels such as X, A, B, 1, 2, etc. are not consistently
styled (roman/italic, upper/lower case).</p>

<p><b>Table of Contents</b>:<br />
The numbering system and font styling of the TOC is not consistent
within the TOC nor with the corresponding headings in the text, and some
TOC entries correspond to in-line text rather than to true headings. No
attempt has been made to remedy these inconsistencies. One missing TOC
entry has been inserted.</p>

<p><b>Index</b>:<br />
The index is shown as it originally appeared &ndash; with some entries
not in correct alphabetic sequence.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="iii"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii"></a></span></p>

<p>In the following pages an attempt has been made to emphasize
the value of Embryology and Comparative Anatomy in
elucidating the difficult and often complicated morphological
problems encountered in the study of human adult anatomy.</p>

<p>Moreover, in addition to the direct advance in the method and
scope of anatomical teaching afforded by these aids, it is further
hoped that the broader interpretation, both of structure and function,
obtained by ontogenetic and phylogenetic comparison, will
impart an interest to the study of adult human morphology, such
as the subject, considered solely in the narrow field of its own
limitations, could never arouse.</p>

<p>The book represents part of the course in visceral anatomy as
developed during the past fourteen years at Columbia University.
The sections dealing with the morphology of the vertebrate
ileo-colic junction and with the structural details of the human
cæcum and appendix are considered somewhat more fully, as
warranted by the extensive material available. The illustrations
are for the greater part taken from preparations in the
Morphological Museum of the University. Wherever practicable
the direct photographic reproduction of the actual preparation is
given. In the case of preparations not suitable for this purpose,
careful drawings have been made which offer in every instance a
faithful and correct interpretation of the conditions presented by
the actual object. A number of the embryonic illustrations are
taken from the standard text-books on the subject, due credit
being given to their source. I desire to express my sincere
thanks to Dr. Edward Leaming, of the Department of Photography
and to Mr. M. Petersen, artist of the Anatomical Department
of the University, for their skilful and thoroughly reliable
work in the preparation of the illustrations.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span></p>

<p>In considering the anatomy of the human abdominal cavity
and peritoneum in the following pages the explanation of the
adult conditions encountered is based upon the development of
the parts, and the successive human embryonal stages are illustrated
by the examination of the lower vertebrates presenting
permanent adult structural conditions which appear as merely
temporary embryonal stages in the development of the higher
mammalian alimentary tract.</p>

<p>For the sake of clearness and brevity all discussion of the <i>theories
of peritoneal development</i> has been designedly omitted. The assumption
of peritoneal <i>adhesion</i>, and consequent obliteration of
serous areas, offers many advantages in considering the adult
human abdominal cavity, especially from the standpoint of comparative
anatomy. The same has consequently been adopted
without reference to divergent views and theories.</p>

<p>In studying the descriptive text and the diagrams the student
should remember that the volume offers in no sense a complete
or detailed account of the development of the abdominal cavity
and its contents. The purpose is not to present the embryology
of this portion of the vertebrate body, but to <i>utilize</i> certain embryological
facts in order to <i>explain</i> the complicated adult conditions
encountered. To avoid confusion, and to bring the salient points
into strong relief, the majority of the diagrams illustrating human
embryonal stages are purely schematic.</p>

<p>Moreover, in order to avoid confusing and unnecessary details
it is often desirable to disregard developmental chronology entirely.
Many of the diagrams combine several successive developmental
stages, showing different degrees of development in
different portions of the same drawing. Again it is frequently<span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
necessary, for the sake of brevity and clearness, to actually depart
from known embryological conditions. If, for example, the stomach
and liver are treated as if they were from their inception
abdominal organs, the student of systematic embryology will recall
the fact that this position is only <i>obtained after</i> their primitive
differentiation by growth and migration.</p>

<p>Again the mesenteries are treated here as if they formed definite
and well-defined membranes from the beginning&mdash;without reference
to the abdominal organs with which they are associated. We
speak of the liver as growing into and between the layers of the
ventral mesogastrium, because this conception offers the opportunity
of more clearly explaining the adult condition. Actually,
however, the membrane develops, as a new structure, after the
first differentiation of liver and stomach, as these organs descend
into the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p>Similar discrepancies between fact and schema are encountered
throughout. Consequently, while the purpose of the volume is to
facilitate the study and comprehension of the <i>adult</i> peritoneal
cavity and its contents, the reader should guard against receiving
the developmental illustration as a correct successive and detailed
account of the <i>embryology</i> of the parts concerned.</p>

<p>In like manner the comparative anatomical facts adduced form
in no sense even approximately a complete serial morphological
account of the vertebrate alimentary tract.</p>

<p>To the student of human anatomy the zoölogical position of the
forms which help him to understand complicated human structural
conditions is immaterial. He can draw on all the vertebrate
classes independently of their mutual relations. Hence
neither ontogeny nor phylogeny are here introduced, except as
aids to the study of adult human anatomy. The following pages
offer neither an embryology nor a comparative anatomy of the
alimentary tract, but an attempt has been made in them to illustrate
the significance of the complicated anatomical details presented
by the adult human abdominal cavity by reference to the
simpler antecedent conditions encountered during the early de<span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>velopmental
stages of the higher forms and permanently in the
structure of the lower vertebrates.</p>

<p>While, as just stated, a complete presentation of the development
of the abdominal cavity is not required, yet the student
will find it of advantage to rehearse the main facts of vertebrate
embryology, for the purpose of bringing a clear understanding of
the manner in which the vertebrate body is built up to bear upon
the problems which the special organs and structures of the body-cavity
present for his consideration. This purpose can be accomplished
by a very brief and condensed consideration of the cardinal
facts.</p>

<p>The entire vertebrate body is the product of developmental
changes taking place after fertilization in a single primitive <span class="lowercase smcap">CELL</span>,
the <span class="lowercase smcap">EGG</span> or <span class="lowercase smcap">OVUM</span> (Fig. 1).</p>

<p>In structure the ovum corresponds to other animal cells. On
account of their special significance during development the different
component parts of the egg-cell have received special distinctive
names. The <i>cell-body</i> is known as the <i>vitellus</i> or <i>yolk</i>.
It is composed of two substances, the <i>protoplasm</i> or formative yolk
and the <i>deuteroplasm</i> or nutritive yolk, which vary in their relative
proportions in the ova of different animals.</p>

<p>The protoplasm represents the material from which in the
course of development the cells forming the body of the individual
are derived, while the deuteroplasm serves for the nutrition
of the ovum during the earliest stages of development.</p>

<p>The <i>nucleus</i> of the egg-cell is distinguished as the <i>germinal vesicle</i>,
and its <i>nucleolus</i> as the <i>germinal spot</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>cell-body</i> or <i>vitellus</i> is surrounded by a condensed portion of
the cell contents to which the name of the vitelline membrane has
been applied, which in turn is enclosed by a transparent and elastic
cover, the <i>zona pellucida</i>, presenting a radially striated appearance.</p>

<p>The ovum is contained in the cortical portion of the ovary, enclosed
in the <i>Graafian follicle</i>, a vesicle 4-8&nbsp;mm. in diameter,
whose fibrous walls are lined by several layers of epithelial cells,
which surround the ovum, forming the <i>discus proligerus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span></p>

<p>After impregnation the egg-cell, by a process of repeated division
or cleavage, undergoes <i>segmentation</i>, the cell-body being divided
successively into two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two, etc., <i>cells</i>,
called <i>blastomeres</i> (Figs. 2 and 3). The mass of cells finally resulting
from this process of segmentation forms the ground work
of the future body. A vertebrate ovum in this stage of complete
segmentation is called the <i>morula</i> from its resemblance to
a mulberry (Fig. 4).</p>

<p>After segmentation is completed a cavity filled with fluid and
surrounded by the developing cells is gradually formed in the
interior of the mass. This cavity is known as the <i>segmentation-cavity</i>.
The egg is now called the <i>blastula</i>, <i>blastosphere</i> or <i>blastodermic
vesicle</i> and the cellular membrane enclosing the segmentation-cavity
forms the <i>germinal membrane</i> or <i>blastoderm</i> (Figs. 5
and <a href="#Fig_6">6</a>). The cells of the blastoderm become aggregated at one
point on the circumference of the vesicle (dorsal pole of blastosphere)
forming, when viewed from above, a thickened biscuit or
disk-shaped opaque area. This is known as the <i>germinal area</i>,
or <i>primitive blastoderm</i> or <i>embryonic shield</i> (<a href="#Fig_7">Figs. 7</a> and <a href="#Fig_12">12</a>).</p>

<p>Transverse sections at right angles to the long axis of the embryonic

primitive germinal membrane becomes differentiated first into
two (Fig. 10) and subsequently into three layers of cells (Fig.
11). At the margins of the germinal area these layers are of
course continuous with the rest of yolk-sac wall. From their
position in reference to the center of the cell the three layers of
the blastoderm are described as&mdash;</p>

axis of the embryonic area (Figs. 13, 14, <a href="#Fig_16">16</a> and <a href="#Fig_17">17</a>), and by the
subsequent union in the dorsal midline of the ridges bounding

</div>

<p>The following changes in the ventral aspect lead to the formation
of the alimentary canal and body-cavity:</p>

<p>The developing embryo at first lies flat on the subjacent yolk-mass,
and subsequently becomes gradually separated more and
more from the rest of the blastoderm by grooves or furrows which
develop along the sides and at the cephalic and caudal extremity
of the embryo. The folds resulting from these furrows indent
the yolk more and more as development proceeds and tend to
approach each other at a central point, the future <i>umbilicus</i>.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile changes in the region of the mesoderm have
led to conditions which produce a differentiation of the ventral
portion of the embryo into two tubes or cylinders, the <i>alimentary</i>
or <i>intestinal canal</i> and the <i>general body-cavity</i>, the former being
included within the latter.</p>

<p>Early in the course of development a number of spaces appear
in the mesoderm on each side of the axial line of the embryo.
These spaces soon unite to form two large cavities, one on each
side. Taken together these cavities constitute the <i>c&oelig;lom</i> or
<i>body-cavity</i>, which becomes subdivided in the adult mammal into
the pleural, pericardial and abdominal cavities.</p>

<p>As these c&oelig;lom cavities develop in the mesoderm the cells lining
them become distinctly epithelial. This mesodermic epithelium
lining the c&oelig;lom is called the <i>mesothelium</i>.</p>

<p>The development of the c&oelig;lom space divides the mesoderm on
each side into an outer leaf, the <i>somatic</i> or <i>parietal mesoderm</i>, and
an inner leaf, the <i>splanchnic</i> or <i>visceral mesoderm</i> (Figs. 18 and<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
19). The former is closely applied to the ectoderm, forming
with it the <i>somatopleure</i> or <i>body-wall</i>. The latter, in close contact
with the entoderm, forms with it the <i>splanchnopleure</i> or wall
of the alimentary canal. In the dorsal median line both somatic
and splanchnic mesoderm become continuous with each other
and with the axial mesoderm (Fig. 20).</p>

</div>

<p>The folds of the splanchnopleure, indenting the yolk-sac, form
a gutter directly connected with the yolk, the <i>primitive intestinal
groove</i> or <i>furrow</i>, whose margins gradually approach each other
(Fig. 20). In this way the primitive alimentary canal becomes
separated from the yolk. At first this separation is ill-defined,
and the channel of communication between the primitive intestine
and the yolk is wide (<a href="#Fig_13">Figs. 13</a>, <a href="#Fig_16">16</a>, <a href="#Fig_17">17</a> and 19). The
folding of the splanchnopleure completes, at an early period, the
dorsal and lateral walls of the embryonic gut, but ventrally,
toward the yolk, the tube is incomplete and widely open.</p>

<p>By union and coalescence of the splanchnopleural folds, proceeding
from the caudal and cephalic ends towards the center,
this primitive wide channel gradually becomes narrowed down,
until the communication between the yolk-sac and the intestine
is reduced to a canal, the <i>vitello-intestinal</i> or <i>omphalo-mesenteric
duct</i>. The intestinal gutter is thus converted into a closed tube
except at the point of implantation of the vitelline duct during
the persistence of this structure. In the meanwhile the somatopleural
folds forming the body-walls grow more and more together
from the sides, approaching the vitello-intestinal duct. Finally
touching each other they coalesce to form the ventral body wall,
in the same manner as the splanch[n]opleural folds met and united
to form the alimentary tube.</p>

<p>At the same time the vitello-intestinal duct and the remnant
of the yolk-sac, to which it was attached (&ldquo;umbilical vesicle&rdquo;),
normally become obliterated and disappear.</p>

<p>After the intestinal tube and the body cavity have thus become
closed the embryo straightens out and the alimentary canal appears
as a nearly straight cylindrical tube extending from the<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
cephalic to the caudal end of the embryo. This primitive alimentary
tube at first terminates at its cephalic extremity in a blind
pouch, while at the caudal end in the early stages the intestine is
connected with the nerve-tube by a channel called the <i>neuro-enteric
canal</i>, forming in the earliest embryos a communication between
the ectoderm lining the bottom of the medullary groove and the
entoderm (Figs. 22 and <a href="#Fig_26">26</a>). In man this stage is encountered
very early, in embryos of 2&nbsp;mm. before the formation of either
heart or provertebræ.</p>

</div></td></tr>
</table>

<p>At the point where the canal develops the primitive groove
presents a thickened circumvallate spot, marking the beginning
perforation of the medullary plate from the ectoderm to the entoderm.
The canal exists only for a short period during the earliest
stages of embryonal life. It becomes rapidly closed, the neural
and intestinal tubes henceforth remaining permanently separated
from each other.</p>

<p>The embryonal caudal end of the primitive alimentary canal is
not the final adult termination of the tube. When the anal aperture
is formed in a manner to be presently detailed, the opening
is situated cephalad of the portion connected with the nerve-tube
by the neuro-enteric canal. Hence this terminal portion of the
early embryonic alimentary canal is called the &ldquo;post-anal gut&rdquo;
(Fig. 21).</p>

<p>The post-anal gut and the neuro-enteric canal are better developed
in the embryos of the lower than in those of the higher
vertebrates. But in all vertebrates of the present day both of
these structures undergo regressive changes and finally disappear
altogether. They serve to recall conditions which existed in
bygone ages, and, while they have a long and significant phylogenetic
history, they have lost among living vertebrates all physiological
importance.</p>

<p>After closure of the neuro-enteric canal and obliteration of the
post-anal gut the alimentary tube ends, during a short period,
both cephalad and caudad in a blind pouch. Very soon, however,
the ectoderm becomes invaginated at both extremities and<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
finally perforates into the lumen of the intestine, thus establishing
the oral and anal communications with the exterior. The
anal ectodermal invagination (proctodæum) (Fig. 21), is smaller
than the oral (stomadæum) (<a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>), but the intestinal tube
forms an extensive pouch in the anal region which descends to
meet the ectodermal invagination of the proctodæum. The details
of the embryonic processes leading to the final establishment
of the adult condition are of great interest on account of the
pathological importance of abnormal or arrested development in
these parts. Failure of the caudal intestinal pouch to establish a
communication with the anal invagination, or failure of development
in either anal invagination or intestinal pouch, leads to the
condition known as atresia ani or imperforate anus, of which
there are several varieties.</p>

<p>Before the anal opening forms the primitive caudal intestine
receives from above the stalk of the <i>allantois</i>, while the
Wolffian duct, the canal of the embryonic excretory apparatus,
also opens into it. The renal bud on the Wolffian duct in
<a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a> indicates the beginning development of the permanent
kidney (metanephros), and the proximal portion of the allantoic
stalk is destined to form by a spindle-shaped enlargement the
future urinary bladder (<a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>). The caudal gut has as yet
no anal opening. Ventrad of the tail end of the embryo the
ectoderm presents at this time a depression (Fig. 21). The
ectoderm lining the bottom of this anal fossa or depression is
separated by a little mesoderm tissue from the entodermal lining
of the blind pouch of the caudal gut. Ectoderm and entoderm
in this region with the intervening mesodermal layer
form the <i>cloacal membrane</i> (Fig. 21).</p>

<p><b>Development of Cloaca.</b>&mdash;The entodermal pouch or prolongation
sent down from the end-gut to meet the anal invagination enlarges
and dilates to form a short wide piece of the intestinal
tube into which open on the one hand the urinary and sexual
ducts of the genito-urinary system, while it receives on the
other the termination of the <i>end-gut proper</i> (<a href="#Fig_28">Figs. 28</a> and <a href="#Fig_29">29</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>This is the permanent condition of the terminal openings of the
alimentary and genito-urinary tracts in the lower vertebrates. It
is found in certain fishes, in all amphibia, reptiles and birds, and
occurs also in one order of mammals, the monotremes. In man
and mammals generally the anal orifice is separated from the
genito-urinary opening, lying dorsad of the same and provided
with special sphincters. Only in the monotremes do the anus
and the genito-urinary tract open into a common cloaca surrounded
by a sphincter common to the anal and genito-urinary
openings (sphincter cloacæ). In birds, reptiles, amphibia and
many fishes (especially the Plagiostomata) this cloacal formation
is the rule. In many fishes, especially the Teleosts, the anus and
the genito-urinary openings are separate, as in mammals, but their
position is reversed, the anus being ventral, while the genito-urinary
opening is placed dorsally.</p>

<p>Fig. 23 shows the cloaca in a female specimen of <i>Iguana
tuberculata</i>. The ventral wall of the cloaca has been divided to
the left of the median line and turned over to the right, carrying
with it the cloacal opening of the bladder. The termination of
the alimentary canal opens into the cloaca from above.</p>

<p>A transverse fold of the mucosa separates this upper compartment
of the cloaca (<i>coprodæum</i>) from a lower space (<i>urodæum</i>)
which receives in its dorsal wall the openings of the two oviducts
and immediately above them&mdash;upon two papillæ&mdash;the openings of
the ureters, while the ventral wall contains the cloacal opening
of the bladder.</p>

<p>The right ovary has been removed&mdash;to show the abdominal opening
of the right oviduct&mdash;by dividing the mesovarian peritoneal
fold.</p>

<p>Fig. 25 shows the male genito-urinary tract and the cloaca in
the monotreme, <i>Platypus anatinus</i>. The cloaca is a spacious sac
formed by the confluence of the rectum and the genito-urinary
sinus.</p>

<p>The penis, consisting of two large cavernous bodies, is contained
in a fibrous sac which arises from the junction of the genito-urinary
sinus and the cloaca, and is continued into the ventral
wall of the cloaca near its termination by an opening through
which the penis can pass into the cloaca and beyond the external
cloacal aperture.</p>

<p>The semen enters the penis at its root through a narrow opening
situated close to the junction of genito-urinary sinus and cloaca.</p>

<p>For a short period, therefore, the human embryo and the embryos
of the higher mammalia present conditions which correspond
to the permanent structure of the parts in these lower vertebrates.
In human embryos of 11.5&nbsp;mm. cervico-coccygeal measure (32-33
days) (Fig. 28), the cloaca appears as a short sac continuous
dorsad with the intestine, ventrad with the rudiment of the
urinary bladder. The larger portion of the caudal gut (postanal
gut) has disappeared, having been reduced to a thin epithelial
strand which gradually becomes entirely absorbed. Only the
proximal portion of the end-gut is used for the development of the
cloaca, which, however, at first has no external opening (Fig. 28).</p>

<p>The tail end of the embryo becomes more extended and between
it and the umbilical cord an interval appears in which the genital
protuberance develops. Behind this point the ventral cloacal
wall is formed by the cloacal membrane.</p>

<p>A considerable interval also develops between the points of entrance
into the cloaca of the intestine proper and of the allantoic
stalk (urinary bladder). The growth of the mesoderm pushes<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
the intestine against the sacral vertebræ, while the stalk of the
allantois with the rudimentary urinary bladder is forced against
the ventral abdominal wall. These changes prepare the way for
the first appearance of the <i>genito-urinary sinus</i>. The neck of the
embryonic bladder elongates and receives the ducts of the urinary
and genital glands (Fig. 29). In embryos of 14&nbsp;mm. cervico-coccygeal
measure (36-37 days) (Figs. 29 and 30), the genito-urinary
sinus perforates the cloacal membrane on the ventral
aspect of the genital protuberance, forming the <i>uro-genital cleft</i>.
The rectum remains closed for a few days longer. The perforation
is preceded by the formation of a transverse ectodermal reduplication,
producing a depression called the <i>transverse anal fissure</i>.
This depression increases in depth until a distinct anal invagination
results, known as the <i>proctodæum</i>, which grows as a funnel-shaped
fossa toward the blind termination of the endgut. In
embryos of 25&nbsp;mm. cervico-coccygeal measure (8&frac12;-9 weeks) the
intestine still ends in a blind pouch. The anus is, therefore,
independent of the end-gut in its development. It is derived
from the ectoderm and its production is analogous to the formation
of the oral cavity by means of the ectodermal invagination
called the <i>stomadæum</i>.</p>

<p>Finally the cloaca is converted into a ventral tube from which
part of the urinary bladder, the urethra and genito-urinary sinus
develop, and a dorsal tube from which the <i>rectum</i> is derived.
This double disposition of the cloaca is accomplished by gradual
changes in the entoderm and mesoderm. The entoderm proliferates
until a partition is formed which separates the two divisions
of the cloacal tube from each other, and the mesoderm likewise
increases, surrounding the newly formed entodermal tubes with
tissue from which the muscles, connective tissue and blood vessels
of the parts are derived (<a href="#Fig_28">Figs. 28</a> and <a href="#Fig_29">29</a>).</p>

<p>This partition, the <i>septum uro-rectale</i>, develops symmetrically
on each side, appearing first as paired folds on the right and left
sides called the <i>internal perineal folds</i> (<a href="#Fig_28">Figs. 28</a> and <a href="#Fig_29">29</a>). When
these folds have reached the cloacal membrane they complete the<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
separation of the cloaca into two adjacent canals. Each of these
canals is still closed caudad by its respective portion of the cloacal
membrane, now divided into an <i>anal</i> and <i>uro-genital</i> segment.
These two portions of the original cloacal membrane become perforated
separately, the uro-genital before the anal. Hence the
external opening of the uro-genital sinus is the first to appear, to
be followed by the anal perforation. The internal perineal folds
are supplemented by the formation of similar external folds, ridges
of mesoderm tissue which surround the anal orifice in the form of
a low wall and thus deepen the anal ectodermal invagination into
the fossa of the proctodæum.</p>

</div>

<p>These developmental stages in the formation of the end-gut are
of importance because they offer the explanation of the pathological
conditions which result from an arrest of development and
from the failure of either the uro-genital or anal opening to form
in the usual manner. These malformations must date back to an
early stage, and probably have their inception in disturbances
occurring in the normal development between the 15th and 23d
day (embryos of 3-6&nbsp;mm.). Perhaps in some cases of atresia there
may be a secondary obliteration of a previously formed opening.
In Fig. 31 the proctodæum persists but the perforation of the
anal membrane into the end-gut has not occurred. The ectoderm
of the anal fossa and the intestinal entoderm remain separated by
a transverse mesodermal partition. Different degrees of this malformation
are observed. The layer separating the skin from the
blind end of the rectum may be so thin that the meconium contained
in the latter can be felt through it. On the other hand
the rectum may terminate high up in a blind pouch, which is
separated from the skin by a distance of several centimeters.</p>

<p>We may now briefly consider the genetic, histological and mechanical
conditions which the above-outlined course of development
imposes on the alimentary tract.</p>

<p>The ectoderm forms the superficial covering of the embryo and
in the dorsal axial line develops the medullary groove which
subsequently becomes converted into the cerebro-spinal axis by<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
closure of the medullary plates and inclusion of the neural tube
within the surrounding mesoblast (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>). The entoderm
forms the epithelial lining of the interior of the alimentary canal
and its appendages and derivatives (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>). The mesoderm
furnishes the skeletal, muscular and vascular systems. At first
single, like the two remaining layers of the blastoderm, the mesoderm
splits early on each side of the chorda dorsalis into two
layers, including between them spaces which after coalescence
form the <i>primitive pleuro-peritoneal</i> or <i>body-cavity</i> (<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>). One
of these mesodermal layers bounding this space becomes closely
connected with the ectoderm, forming the <i>somatopleure</i> or body
wall, while the other joins the entoderm to complete the wall of
the alimentary canal, forming the <i>splanchnopleure</i>. In the course
of further development the edges of these two layers approach
each other ventrally in the median line and finally fuse.</p>

<p>The products of this fusion are two epithelial tubes, one included
within the other, with walls reinforced by tissue derived from the
two layers of the mesoderm. The internal or entodermal tube is
of much smaller diameter than the outer or ectodermal tube, but
much longer. The walls of the two tubes are placed in contact
with each other by their mesodermal elements dorsally in the
axial line, but elsewhere are separated from each other by
the body-cavity (except in the region of the ventral mesogastrium).</p>

<p>The splanchnopleure is not so wide as the somatopleure. As it
closes in the ventral median line it includes the deepest or entodermal
layer. It now forms a tube whose walls are composed
superficially of mesoderm (splanchnopleure) while the lumen is
lined by epithelium derived from the entoderm. This tube is the
<i>primitive enteric</i> or <i>alimentary canal</i>. The somatopleuric layers
bounding the body cavity take a wider sweep and after they have
united ventrally in the median line they embrace a much more
extensive space, the <i>primitive body cavity</i> or <i>c&oelig;lom</i>. The walls of
this space are largely made up of the skeletal and muscular elements
developed from the mesoderm of the somatopleure, cov<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>ered
superficially by the common ectodermal investment of the
body. It will be seen that the enteric tube thus becomes included
within the wider and more capacious c&oelig;lom cavity.</p>

<p>Both the somatic and the splanchnic leaf of the mesoderm
consist at first solely of a layer of flattened epithelial cells, the
mesothelium. But very early this tissue is increased to form a
massive layer by direct development from the mesothelium. The
new mesodermal cells thus produced constitute the <i>mesenchyma</i>,
which includes the whole of the mesoderm of the embryo except
the mesothelial lining of the c&oelig;lom. The cells of the mesenchyma,
connected with each other and with the mesothelial cells
by protoplasmic processes, are not as close together as in an epithelium
and do not form a continuous membrane. By migration
and multiplication a large mass of mesodermal tissue is produced
which fills the entire space between the mesothelium and the
primary germ layers. The mesenchymal tissue between the mesothelium
and the ectoderm forms the mass of the skeletal, muscular
and vascular systems. The mesenchymal tissue between the
mesothelium and the entoderm forms an important constituent
of the alimentary canal and of its appendages. The entoderm
furnishes the internal epithelial lining of the tube upon which
the performance of the specific physiological function of the entire
apparatus depends. This epithelial tube is covered from
without by the splanchnic mesoderm. The mesodermal elements
thus added to the enteric entodermal tube consist of connective
tissue and muscular fibers. The latter, arranged in the form of
circular and longitudinal layers, control the contractility of the
tube and regulate the propulsion of the contents. The connective
tissue of the splanchnic mesoderm appears as an intermediate
layer uniting the epithelial lining and the muscular walls. Situated
thus between the mucous and muscular coats of the intestine
this layer is known as the <i>submucosa</i>. It contains, imbedded
in its tissue, the glandular elements of the intestine derived from
the entodermal epithelium, and the blood vessels, lymphatics and
nerves. The second chief function of the splanchnic and somatic<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
mesoderm is the production of the serous membrane investing the
body cavity and its contents from the mesothelium lining the
primitive c&oelig;lom. This mesothelial tissue, differentiated as a
layer of flattened cells, lines the interior of the body cavity and
covers the superficial aspect of the enteric tube. By subsequent
partition of the common c&oelig;lom the great serous membranes of
the adult, the pleuræ, pericardium and peritoneum, are developed
from it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 420px;">

<i>B.</i> later condition. (Minot.)
</div>

<p>The entodermal enteric tube is, as already stated, closely attached
at an early period along its dorsal surface to the axial rod of
mesoderm containing the chorda dorsalis immediately ventrad of
the neural canal. In the earliest stages, just after the splanchnopleure
and somatopleure have closed to complete the alimentary
tube and body cavity, the remnant of these layers extends between
the ventral abdominal wall and the ventral surface of the intestine
forming a partition which divides the body into a right and left
half. (Fig. 32, <i>A.</i>) For the most part this primitive connection
between the ventral abdominal wall and the intestinal tube is lost
very early. The stomach, however, is always connected by a
ventral mesogastrium, from which the lesser omentum is derived,
to the ventral body wall. The disappearance of the ventral mesentery
caudad of this point establishes the condition indicated
in Fig. 32, <i>B.</i> The entodermal tube and the surrounding splanchnic
mesoderm forming the intestinal canal is attached along its
dorsal surface to the axial mesoderm of the dorsal mid-line. The
primitive mesothelial peritoneum is reflected along this line from
the internal surface of the body wall upon the ventral and lateral
surfaces of the intestine. The c&oelig;lom of one side communicates
ventrad of the intestine with the c&oelig;lom of the opposite side.
Hence by the disappearance of the ventral mesentery caudad of
the stomach the paired body-cavities have become fused into a
single abdominal cavity&mdash;while cephalad the original division into
right and left halves is maintained by the portion of the ventral
mesentery which attaches the stomach to the ventral abdominal
wall. The mesodermal tissue which at this time attaches the<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
alimentary tube along its entire extent to the dorsal wall of the
c&oelig;lom carries the primitive embryonic arterial vessel, the aorta.
This vessel supplies a series of small branches to the intestine,
which reach the same by passing ventrad imbedded in the mesoderm
connecting the tube to the dorsal body wall.</p>

<p>With the further development of the alimentary canal a gradual
elongation of this connecting band of mesoderm and of the contained
vessels is observed, the tube itself gradually receding from
the vertebral axis. The early broad attachment is replaced by a
narrower stalk into which the mesoderm is drawn out. With
this narrowing in the transverse and elongation in the sagittal
direction the connecting tissue assumes the character of a thin
membrane with two free serous surfaces, including the intestinal
vessels imbedded between them. Coincident with this elongation
of the enteric attachment and its narrowing in the transverse direction
the primitive intestine becomes more completely invested
by the serous lining membrane of the c&oelig;lom cavity. In this
stage we can speak of the double-layered membrane attaching
the tube to the dorsal body wall and carrying the intestinal blood-vessels
as the primitive dorsal mesentery. The intestinal canal
itself is invested by serous membrane except along a narrow strip
of its dorsal border where the mesentery is attached and where
the vessels reach the intestine. We can now distinguish the
serous lining membrane of the abdominal cavity, derived from
the mesothelium of the splanchnic and somatic mesoderm as the
<i>peritoneum</i>. The membrane presents the following topographical
subdivisions:</p>

<p>1. <i>Parietal Peritoneum</i>, lining the inner surface of the abdominal
walls.</p>

<p>2. <i>Visceral Peritoneum</i>, investing the external surface of the
intestine and its derivatives.</p>

<p>3. <i>Mesenteric Peritoneum</i>, connecting these two, carrying the
intestinal blood vessels and lymphatics and acting as a suspensory
support to the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>The dorsal mesentery in fishes, amphibia and reptiles contains<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
smooth muscular fibers derived from the mesoderm. These bands
of smooth muscle fibers are also encountered, though less well developed,
in the mesentery of birds and mammals. The so-called
&ldquo;suspensory muscle of the duodenum&rdquo; belongs to this category.
It consists of a few strands of unstriped muscular and fibrous
tissue which passes from the præaortal tissue around the origin of
the superior mesenteric artery and c&oelig;liac axis to the duodeno-jejunal
angle. Fasciculi from this band may penetrate into the
root of the mesentery (Gegenbaur).</p>

<p>Similar muscular fasciculi have been observed in the peritoneal
folds of the ileo-cæcal junction (Luschka) and in the mesorectum&mdash;forming
in the latter situation the recto-coccygeal muscles of
Treitz, and in the female the recto-uterine muscles.</p>

<p>In its earlier stages the primitive common mesentery forms a
membrane which carries the intestinal blood vessels between its two
layers, surrounds the embryonic alimentary canal and attaches
the same to the ventral aspect of the chorda dorsalis and aorta.
This is the permanent condition in many of the lower vertebrates
in which the intestinal tube is suspended by a simple dorsal
mesentery, a condition which is repeated by the embryos of man
and the higher vertebrates. From this primitive common mesentery
are derived, by further development, displacement and adhesion,
all the other mesenteries, omenta and peritoneal folds of the
adult. The character and degree of these subsequent changes is
determined by the increase in length and change in position of
the intestine and the growth of large organs, like liver, spleen
and pancreas. Many portions of the intestinal canal, at first suspended
by the mesentery and freely movable within the abdominal
cavity, become later, by secondary adhesion, firmly connected
with adjacent portions of the tube or with the abdominal
parietes.</p>

<p>In certain of the lower vertebrates (fishes) large sections of the
intestine lie entirely free within the abdomen, their only connection
with the parietes being afforded by the blood vessels.
This condition depends upon <i>absorption</i> of the original mesentery.<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
A similar process, though much more circumscribed, is observed
in the omenta of many mammals, which appear perforated at several
points.</p>

<p><b>Derivatives of the Entodermal Intestinal Tube.</b>&mdash;The entodermal
epithelium is physiologically the characteristic element of the
alimentary canal. Besides lining the entire internal surface of
the tube it gives rise by budding and protrusion from the intestinal
canal to a series of organs which from the mode of their
development must be regarded as diverticular or derivatives of the
alimentary canal (Figs. 33, 34, and 35). These organs, proceeding
in order cephalo-caudad, are the following:</p>

<p class="ml2em">
The salivary glands.<br />
Thymus and thyroid.<br />
The lungs.<br />
Pancreas.<br />
Liver.<br />
</p>

<p>The epithelium of all these structures is derived from the primitive
entoderm of the intestinal tube, except the epithelium of the
salivary glands, which, being derived from the stomadæal invagination,
is ectodermal in character. We have previously noted the
general history and appearance of the yolk-sac and its connection
by means of the vitello-intestinal duct with the intestine. In
contradistinction to the adult organs just noted the yolk-sac or
umbilical vesicle is merely a temporary embryonal appendage to
the alimentary canal. It also differs from them in the fact that
it is not an extension or budding from the completed intestinal
tube, like the liver and pancreas, but indicates, by the implantation
of the duct (<a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>), the last point at which closure of the
intestinal canal takes place, when after obliteration of the duct
the separation of the intestine from the yolk-sac is completed.</p>

<p>The segment of the primitive alimentary canal cephalad of the
attachment of the vitello-intestinal duct gives rise to the pharynx,
&oelig;sophagus, stomach, proximal portion of small intestine proper
and its derivatives, the liver and pancreas.</p>

does not become absorbed, but persists and continues to develop
as a part of the small intestine, forming the blind pouch or
appendage known as <i>Meckel&rsquo;s diverticulum</i> (Figs. 37 and 38).
This diverticulum may vary in length from 1.5 to 15&nbsp;cm. It
either projects freely into the abdominal cavity as a pouch arising
from the convex border of the small intestine opposite to the
mesenteric attachment, or else it reaches the abdominal wall at
the umbilicus and is attached to the same. In a few instances it
has not terminated in a blind pouch, but has remained open at
the umbilicus, in which case the aperture discharges intestinal
contents. Sometimes the process of obliteration which normally
leads to the absorption of the vitello-intestinal duct extends to
the adjoining segment of the small intestine, resulting in obliteration
of the intestinal lumen and consequent obstruction at
this point.</p>

<p>While the obliteration and complete absorption of the duct is
normal in nearly all vertebrates, a remnant persists in some
birds, in which a short cæcal pouch (<i>diverticulum cæcum vitelli</i>) is
found at about the middle of the small intestine. A portion of
the vitello-intestinal duct thus persists throughout life in some
wading and swimming birds. Figs. 39 and 40 show this condition
in the small intestine of <i>Urinator lumme</i> and <i>imber</i>, the red-throated
loon and the great northern diver. In other birds, however,
such as birds of prey, song birds, etc., the duct is absorbed and
disappears completely.</p>

<p>In order to complete the embryological history of the alimentary
canal it is necessary to take brief account of another structure
derived from it, namely the <i>allantois</i>. Its significance to
the adult organism is seen in connection with the genito-urinary
tract, the urinary bladder being formed by its persistent portion.<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
In the embryo, however, it has important nutritive and respiratory
functions. In the embryos of the higher vertebrates nutrition
depends only in the earliest stages upon the yolk-sac of the
ovum, over which a vascular network extends.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/fig041.jpg" width="440" height="484" alt="" />
<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_41"></a>Fig. 41.</span>&mdash;Diagram illustrating the later stages in the formation of the mammalian
f&oelig;tal membranes. (Heisler, modified from Roule.)
</div>

<p>Very soon the caudal portion of the primitive intestine develops
a vascular sac-like outgrowth (<a href="#Fig_21">Figs. 21</a> and 41). This pouch
forms the <i>allantois</i>. It is intimately connected with embryonal
respiration, and probably also forms a reservoir which receives
the secretion of the primitive kidney. This foreshadows the
final destiny of the proximal intra-abdominal portion of the
allantoic sac which persists and is converted into the urinary
bladder of the adult.</p>

<p>The allantois is present in Amphibia but is very small. In
Amniota<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> it is large and grows around the embryo. In those of
the higher vertebrates which are developed within an egg (reptiles,
birds and monotremes) the sac of the allantois comes to lie
beneath the egg-shell and acts as a respiratory organ. In the
higher mammalia, developed within the uterus, the allantois becomes
attached by vascular villi to the uterine wall and establishes
a vascular connection between the f&oelig;tal and maternal
blood vessels. In this way the <i>allantoic placenta</i> is formed (Fig.
41). The placenta, as just stated, is absent in the monotremes
and is only slightly developed in marsupials, in which animals
the f&oelig;tus develops to maturity in the marsupial pouch after
leaving the uterus. These animals are therefore distinguished
as <i>Aplacentalia</i> from the remaining higher mammals in which
the allantoic placenta develops and which are hence called the
<i>Placentalia</i>.</p>

<p><b>Summary.</b>&mdash;To recapitulate, therefore, the intestinal tube gives
origin to two kinds of appendages or derivatives:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span></p>
<p>1. Organs of the adult body, derived by budding from the alimentary
entodermal epithelium, in the form of pouch-like diverticula
which follow the glandular type of development and become
secondarily associated with mesodermal elements. These
organs are again of two kinds:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Organs which retain their original connection with the lumen
of the digestive canal:</i></p>

canal.</i></p>

<p>Thymus and Thyroid Gland.</p>

<p>2. Embryonic appendages of the alimentary tract.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The vitello-intestinal or omphalo-mesenteric duct and the
yolk-sac or umbilical vesicle. This structure does not form as an
extension from the intestinal tube after the same has been closed
by coalescence of the splanchnopleure in the ventral mid-line,
but is the result of the folding in of the layers of the embryonic
germinal area, by means of which the body-rudiment is constricted
off from the yolk-sac. The reduced channel of communication
forms the vitello-intestinal duct. In the vast majority of
vertebrates this disappears completely by absorption in the course
of further development. It may persist in part abnormally as
Meckel&rsquo;s diverticulum. In a few birds its proximal portion remains
normally as a small blind pouch attached to the free
border of the small intestine.</p>

Museum, No. 1846.)
</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The allantois. This is a hollow outgrowth from the embryonic
intestinal canal of the higher vertebrates, performing important
functions in connection with the early nutrition of the
embryo. In the course of subsequent development its proximal
portion, situated within the abdominal cavity, becomes converted<span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
into the urinary bladder. In mammals it loses its original connection
with the intestinal canal and is assigned entirely to the
genito-urinary tract. In some of the lower vertebrates, amphibia
and reptiles it retains its connection with the ventral wall of the
cloaca throughout life. (See Fig. 42, genito-urinary tract of
<i>Iguana tuberculata</i>.)</p>

<p>After the intestinal canal has become separated from the yolk-sac
it forms at first a straight tube, running cephalo-caudad beneath
the chorda dorsalis. In most forms, however, the intestine grows
much more rapidly in length than the body-cavity of the embryo
in which it is contained. Hence the intestine is forced to form
coils or convolutions.</p>

<p>The entire alimentary canal, from the mouth to the anus, can
be separated into the following divisions and subdivisions:</p>

<p><b>I. Foregut</b>, including</p>

<p class="ml2em">
1. The oral cavity.<br />
2. The pharynx.<br />
3. The &oelig;sophagus.<br />
4. The stomach.<br />
</p>

<p><b>II. Midgut</b>, closely associated at its beginning with the liver
and pancreas.</p>

<p>It extends between the pyloric extremity of the stomach and
the beginning of the last segment, the endgut, frequently separated
from both by ring-like aggregations of the circular muscular
fibers and corresponding projections of the mucous membrane
(pyloric and ileo-colic valves).</p>

<p>The midgut is usually the longest portion of the intestinal tube.</p>

<p><b>III. Endgut</b>, the last segment of the intestinal canal, courses
through the pelvic portion of the body cavity. From this short
end-piece are developed: (1) The colon, sigmoid flexure and
rectum; (2) the cloaca with the uro-genital sinus and the duct of
the allantois.</p>

<h2>PART I.</h2>

<h2>ANATOMY OF THE PERITONEUM AND
ABDOMINAL CAVITY.</h2>


<p>For the purpose of studying the adult human peritoneum it is
in the first place absolutely necessary to obtain a correct appreciation
of the disposition of the chief viscera within the abdominal
cavity and of their mutual relations. In the second place the
visceral vascular supply of the abdomen must be carefully considered
in order to correctly appreciate certain important relations
of the peritoneal membrane.</p>

<p>A review of the visceral contents of the abdomen shows that
we have to deal chiefly with the divisions of the alimentary tract
below the &oelig;sophagus and the structures directly derived from the
same, as liver and pancreas, or associated topographically with the
alimentary canal, as the spleen. Portions of the urinary and reproductive
systems situated within the abdominal and pelvic
cavities will also require consideration.</p>

<p>The digestive apparatus as a whole presents, in the first place,
a segment designed to convey the food to the stomach, the &oelig;sophagus&mdash;supplemented
in mammalia by the special apparatus of the
mouth and pharynx, in which the food is mechanically prepared
for digestion by chewing and mixed with the secretion of the
salivary glands.</p>

<p>The <i>digestive apparatus proper</i>, succeeding to the &oelig;sophagus, is
usually divisible into two sections differing in function and structure.</p>

<p>1. The <span class="lowercase smcap">STOMACH</span>, a short sac-like dilatation, in which chiefly
nitrogenous material is digested.</p>

<p>2. The <span class="lowercase smcap">SMALL INTESTINE</span>, a long and usually much convoluted
narrow tube, chiefly devoted to the digestion of starches, fats and
sugars, and to the absorption of the digested matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span></p>

<p>In some of the lower vertebrates, as the <i>Cyclostomata</i> (Fig. 43),
<i>Esox</i>, <i>Belone</i>, etc., among fishes (<a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a>), <i>Necturus</i> and <i>Proteus</i>
among amphibians (<a href="#Fig_50">Figs. 50</a> and <a href="#Fig_51">51</a>), the separation of the digestive
portion of the alimentary tract into stomach and small intestine
is not clearly defined (vide infra, <a href="#Page_43">p.&nbsp;43</a>).</p>

<p>A distinct digestive segment may even be entirely wanting,
owing to its failure to differentiate from the &oelig;sophagus on the
one hand and from the endgut on the other. In such forms the
entire digestive canal appears as a tube of uniform caliber extending
from mouth to anus. It is necessary to begin with these
simple structural conditions in order to obtain a clear conception
of the disposition of the viscera in the adult human abdomen.
Such simple arrangement of the alimentary tract is found in the
embryo of man and of the higher vertebrates, and similar rudimentary
types are encountered, as the permanent condition, in
some of the lower forms. These latter are especially valuable for
purposes of study, because they afford an opportunity of examining
directly, as macroscopic objects, structural conditions which
are found only as temporary embryonal stages during the development
of the higher mammalia (Fig. 43).</p>

<p>In the early stages the alimentary tract of the mammalian embryo
consists of a straight tube of nearly uniform caliber (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig.
44</a>, <i>A</i>), extending from the pharynx to the cloaca, along the
median line in the dorsal region of the body cavity, connected
with the ventral aspect of the axial mesoderm by a membranous
fold forming the primitive common dorsal mesentery. Subsequently
differentiation of this simple tube into successive segments
takes place, marked by differences in shape and caliber and in
histological structure.</p>

<p>The first indication of the future stomach appears early, in
human embryos of from 5-6 days (<a href="#Fig_44">Figs. 44</a>, <i>B</i>, and 45; for later
embryonal stomach forms compare also <a href="#Fig_33">Figs. 33</a>, <a href="#Fig_35">35</a> and <a href="#Fig_36">36</a>), as a
small spindle-shaped dilatation of a portion of the primitive entodermal
tube, placed in the median plane, dorsad of the embryonic
outgrowth of the liver, between it and the &oelig;sophagus.<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span> The appearance of this dilatation marks the separation of the
proximal cephalic part (pharynx and &oelig;sophagus) from the
distal caudal (intestinal) portion of the primitive alimentary
canal.</p>

<p>Further growth of the stomach takes place chiefly along the
dorsal margin of the dilatation, rendering the same more convex.
The ventral border develops to a less degree and in the course of
further and more complete differentiation the dorsal margin of
the future stomach assumes even at this period the character of
the greater curvature, while the opposite ventral margin, the
future lesser curvature, following the dilatation of the tube dorsad,
becomes in turn concave (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>, <i>C</i>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 480px;">

<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_46"></a>Fig. 46.</span>&mdash;Alimentary canal of human embryo of 5&nbsp;mm. ×&nbsp;15. (Reconstruction after His.)
</div>

<p>The early spindle-shaped dilatation has therefore assumed the
general shape of the adult organ. This differentiation of greater
and lesser curvature begins to appear in embryos of 5&nbsp;mm. (Fig.
46) and is very well marked in embryos of 12.5&nbsp;mm., <a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>, of
an embryo of five weeks, indicates the adult form of the stomach
clearly.</p>

<p>It will, however, be noted that the &oelig;sophageal entrance is still
at the cephalic extremity of the rudimentary stomach, while
the pyloric transition to the intestine occupies the distal caudal
point, under cover of the liver, and turns with a slight bend
dorsad and to the right to pass into the duodenum. The future
greater curvature is directed dorsad and a little to the left toward
the vertebral column, while the concave lesser curvature is
turned ventrad and a little to the right toward the ventral abdominal
wall. At this time there is but little indication of the
subsequent extension of the organ to the left of the &oelig;sophageal
entrance to form the great cul-de-sac or fundus of the adult
stomach.</p>

<p>In this stage of its development the stomach therefore presents
ventral and dorsal borders, and right and left surfaces, while the
continuity of its lumen with the adjacent segments of the alimentary
canal appears as a proximal or cephalic &oelig;sophageal and a
distal or caudal intestinal opening.</p>

<h3>COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF FOREGUT AND STOMACH.</h3>

<p>A serial review of this portion of the alimentary tract in vertebrates
forms one of the most interesting and instructive chapters
in comparative anatomy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 430px;">

(Columbia University Museum, No. 1694.)
</div>

<p>Not only is every embryonal stage in the development of the
higher mammalia represented permanently in the adult structure
of some of the lower types, but the far-reaching influence of function
and of the physiological demands on the structure of this
portion of the digestive tract is strikingly illustrated by the numerous
and marked modifications which are encountered.</p>

<p>The foregut, strictly speaking, is in mammals separated from
the oral cavity by the musculo-membranous fold of the soft palate
and uvula. In all other vertebrates except the crocodile, the oral
cavity and foregut pass into each other without sharp demarcation
(Fig. 47). In some of the lower vertebrates the alimentary
canal never advances beyond the condition of a simple straight
tube of nearly uniform caliber. There is no gastric dilatation and
hence no differentiation of a stomach properly speaking. Such
for example is the case in some teleost fishes, as the pickerel
(<a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a>). In these forms we have to deal with the persistence
of the early embryonic pregastric stage of the higher types,
before the simple alimentary tube is differentiated by the appearance
of the distinct gastric dilatation.</p>

<p>In the <i>Cyclostomata</i> (<a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>) the intestinal canal passes through
the body in a perfectly straight line and the three segments (mid-,
fore- and hindgut) are not clearly differentiated.</p>

<p>In the <i>Ammoc&oelig;tes</i> the foregut begins behind the wide branchial
basket, dorsad of the heart, with a narrow entrance, which is succeeded
by a dilated segment. The entrance of the hepatic duct
separates fore- and midgut.</p>

<p>In <i>Amphioxus</i> the branchial pouch passes with a slight constriction
directly into the gut which extends through the body-cavity
in a straight line.</p>

<p>The narrow segment is usually regarded as the &ldquo;&oelig;sophagus.&rdquo;
This is followed by a slightly dilated segment, the <span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>&ldquo;stomach,&rdquo;
into which a blind pouch enters. This cæcal pouch is usually considered
as a <i>hepatic</i> diverticulum (<a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a>).</p>

<p>But even in these rudimentary forms the point where the liver develops
from the entodermal intestinal tube marks the separation of fore- and
midgut. The stomach, when it develops, is situated cephalad of the
entrance of the hepatic duct into the intestine. The section cephalad of
the duct opening may be very short, and the food digested further on in
the intestinal tube. Consequently a function which in these lower
vertebrates is assigned to the midgut becomes transferred in the higher
forms to a specialized segment of the foregut, situated cephalad of the
hepato-enteric duct. This segment is the<ins title="Transcriber's Note:

<h3>STOMACH.</h3>

<p>The distribution of the vagus nerve finds its explanation in this
derivation of the stomach. The primitive foregut is formed by
the passage between the branchial cavity and the midgut, and is
within the area supplied by the vagus. Hence when the stomach
develops from the foregut, as a specialized segment of the same, it
is supplied by vagus branches. The vertebrate stomach varies
greatly in size and shape.</p>

<p>The type-form is presented by a longitudinal spindle-shaped
dilatation of the foregut, which retains its f&oelig;tal vertical position
in the long axis of the body. An example of this form, which is
encountered among fishes and amphibia, is presented by the alimentary
tube of <i>Proteus anguineus</i> and <i>Necturus maculatus</i>
(Figs. 50 and 51). Since this condition is common to all vertebrates
in the earliest f&oelig;tal period it can be designated as the f&oelig;tal
or primitive stomach form. All others appear as secondary derivatives
from this typical early condition.</p>

<p>The influences which bring about such derivations and modifications
may be enumerated as follows:</p>

<p>1. The habitual amount of food required by the animal.</p>

<p>2. The volume and digestible character of the food.</p>

</div>

<p>3. The size and shape of the abdominal cavity in which the
stomach is contained.</p>

<p>4. Structural modifications designed to increase the action of
the gastric juice on the food contained in the stomach.</p>

<p>5. The assumption, on part of the stomach, of functions which
are usually relegated to other organs.</p>

<p>Most of the individual stomach forms encountered among vertebrates
owe their production to several of these influences acting
in conjunction.</p>

<p>We may group the main types as follows:</p>

<p><b>1. Stomach Forms Depending on the Influence exerted by the
Habitual Amount of Food required by the Animal.</b>&mdash;The greater the
activity of tissue changes is, the greater will be the amount of
food required and the more pronounced will be the gastric dilatation
of the alimentary canal. Hence in the higher vertebrates
generally the stomach appears as a large and more sac-like dilatation
than in lower forms, such as fishes and amphibia and some
reptilia, in which the stomach is usually smaller and f&oelig;tal in
shape, forming a slight longitudinal dilatation situated in the long
axis of the body. An example is seen in the stomach of <i>Coluber
natrix</i> (Fig. 52). Frequently this slight dilatation is scarcely
differentiated from the &oelig;sophagus at the cephalic and from the
small intestine at the caudal end. Many batrachians and perennibranchiates
possess this form among the amphibia. It is also
encountered in the pickerels, the <i>Cyprini</i>, and in <i>Labrus</i> among
fishes, and in some saurians and ophidia among reptiles. It constitutes
a slight advance in development over the earliest stage
represented, as we have seen, by the nearly uniform and undifferentiated
alimentary tube of amphioxus and the cyclostomata.</p>

<p>This transition of the f&oelig;tal form to the more advanced secondary
types of the stomach is marked by the development of two
important structural features:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The separation in the interior of the canal of the stomach
from the intestine by the appearance of a ring-shaped valve, the
<i>pyloric valve</i>. This is produced by an aggregation of the circular
muscular fibers of the intestine at this point, and causes a projection
of the mucous membrane into the lumen of the canal. It<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
begins to appear in the fishes (pickerel, sturgeon, etc.), is found
in most amphibia and is regularly present in the stomach of the
higher vertebrates. (Figs. 54 and 55.) A good example of the
ring-shaped plate of the pylorus with central circular opening
produced by the aggregation of the circular muscular fibers is afforded
by the view of the interior of the cormorant&rsquo;s stomach given
in <a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>. The opposite or &oelig;sophageal extremity of the stomach
is less well differentiated from the afferent tube of the &oelig;sophagus.</p>

<p>There is no aggregation of muscular circular fibers in this situation
and no valve. Superficially the external longitudinal muscular
fibers of the &oelig;sophagus pass continuously and without
demarcation into the superficial gastric muscular layer. The
separation between &oelig;sophagus and stomach is, however, marked
on the mucous surface by a well-defined line along which the flat,
smooth and glistening &oelig;sophageal tesselated epithelium passes
into the granular cuboidal epithelium of the gastric mucous
membrane. The &oelig;sophageo-gastric junction in the adult human
subject is shown in Fig. 53.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The pyloric end of the stomach makes an angular bend,
while the rest of the organ remains in the original vertical position
in the long axis of the body. An example of this condition
is presented by the stomach of <i>Scincus ocellatus</i> (<a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>; cf. also
<a href="#Fig_202">Fig. 202</a>).</p>

<p>The purpose of both of these provisions is to retain the gastric
contents for a longer time within the stomach. Hence this form
is encountered especially in those fishes and amphibians in which
the nutritive demands require a more complete digestion of the
food taken. This is the case, for example, in <i>Gobius</i> (<a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>),
the plagiostomata (<a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58</a>), and many saurians. The same transitory
stomach form is even found in some mammals, as the seals.
<a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a> shows the stomach in <i>Phoca vitulina</i>, the harbor seal.
With the further increase in the demand for complete digestion of
the food the entire stomach assumes a transverse position to the
long axis of the body. This may occur while the stomach still
retains its primitive tubular form, as in most chelonians (Fig.<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
60). In others the change in position occurs after the gastric
dilatation has assumed the sac-like form, as in many land-turtles,
crocodiles, some batrachians and all higher vertebrates (<a href="#Fig_61">Figs. 61</a>
and <a href="#Fig_62">62</a>). This transverse position, at right angles to the long axis
of the body, forms the starting point for the derivation of all
secondary types of stomach.</p>

usually have a large volume in proportion to the amount

<p><b>4. Stomach Forms Depending on Structural Modifications Designed
to Increase the Action of the Gastric Juice on the Food.</b>&mdash;This purpose
is accomplished:</p>

(Columbia University Museum, No. 67/1804.)
</div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The source of supply of the gastric juice is increased by
adding to the usual gastric glands of the stomach a special accessory
glandular compartment, either placed at the cardia, where
the &oelig;sophagus enters, as in <i>Myoxus</i> or <i>Castor</i> (Fig. 67) or attached
to the body of the stomach to the left of the cardia, as in the
manatee (Fig. 68). The first arrangement is similar to the universal
position of the glandular stomach of birds (Fig. 69). In<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
birds, however, the glandular proventriculus is the <i>only</i> source
of the gastric juice, while in the above-mentioned mammalia
(myoxus and beaver) the accessory glandular stomach is merely
an addition to the supply derived from the usual gastric glands
situated in the body of the organ.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The increase of the length of time during which the food
remains in the stomach subject to the action of the gastric juice
can be accomplished in one of several ways.</p>

<p>1. The stomach, while it retains its general tubular form increases
considerably in length and assumes the shape and structure
found in the human large intestine. It is partially subdivided
by folds projecting into the interior and separating compartments
resembling the colic cells of the human large intestine. The time
required for the passage of food through the stomach is thus increased
and the action of the gastric juice is prolonged and rendered
more intense.</p>

<p>Such modifications of the structure of the stomach are encountered
in <i>Semnopithecus</i> among the monkeys and in the kangaroo,
among marsupials (Figs. 70 and 71).</p>

<p>2. The same purpose is accomplished by the development of
diverticula from the stomach, in which the food is retained and
acted on by the gastric juice for longer periods.</p>

University Museum, No. 1271.)
</div>

<p>The herbivora, omnivora and such carnivora as live on animal
food difficult of digestion furnish examples of this type of stomach.
The same is also found in most teleosts. In the latter the cæcal
gastric pouch lies in the long axis of the body, opposite the entrance
of the &oelig;sophagus. A marked example of this arrangement is seen
in the stomach of the eel, <i>Anguilla anguilla</i> (Fig. 72).</p>


<p>In other forms, and in the mammalia especially, the blind pouch
is developed from the portion of the stomach lying to the left of
the &oelig;sophageal entrance at the cardia, and is hence placed transversely
to the long axis of the body.</p>

<p>This difference in the position of the cul-de-sac is explained by
the small transverse measure of the body in teleosts, while the
greater amount of available space in the abdominal cavity of<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
mammalia permits of the transverse position of the entire stomach
and of the development of the diverticulum from its left extremity.</p>

<p>Most mammals have only a single pouch, whose size varies
with the digestibility of the food habitually taken. It is greater
in herbivora (<a href="#Fig_64">Figs. 64</a> and 73) than in omnivora and carnivora
(Figs. 74 and 75). In some of the latter, as <i>Lutra</i> (<a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a>), the
cul-de-sac is almost wanting.</p>

Assumption by the Stomach of Special Functions, which are Usually

</table>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Storage of food in special receptacles or compartments for
subsequent use.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Mastication of the food is in some animals accomplished
only partly or not at all in the mouth, and is then performed in
the stomach. A portion of the stomach is thus converted into an
apparatus for mastication.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The provisions for these two accessory functions may be
combined in the same stomach.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Many of the higher vertebrates possess in connection with
the alimentary tract additional reservoirs for the storage of food
until used. Such reservoirs are found in mammals and birds
connected with the oral cavity, as cheek-pouches, or with the
&oelig;sophagus, such as the crop of the birds (<a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>). Fig. 80
shows the development of the cheek-pouches in one of the
primates, <i>Macacus nemestrinus</i>.</p>

<p>In many mammals reservoirs of similar import are added directly<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
to the stomach and form an integral part of the organ.
Examples are furnished by the compound stomachs of many
rodents, ruminants, cetaceans and herbivorous edentates. The
peculiar appearance of these stomachs is explained if the additional
reservoirs are in imagination removed and the digestive
stomach proper restored so to speak to the type-form. The proximal
or cardiac portion of the stomach in many rodents is devoid
of gastric glands and must be interpreted as a storage chamber
for food (Fig. 81). The same significance attaches to the corresponding
portion of the manatee&rsquo;s stomach (<a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>).</p>

<p>Similar contrivances are found in the ruminant stomach. The
first and second divisions (rumen and reticulum) are nothing but
sac-like gastric reservoirs or pouches, in which the food is collected,
to be subsequently returned to the mouth for mastication.
When swallowed for the second time the bolus is carried, by the
closure of the so-called &oelig;sophageal gutter, past the first and second
stomach into the digestive apparatus proper (the abomasum)
(Figs. 82 and 83). Many ruminants (<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, <i>Moschus</i>) only have
these three compartments. Most, however, have four, the leaf
stomach or psalterium being intercalated between the retinaculum
and the abomasum. The psalterium contains no digestive glands.
It may possibly serve for the absorption of the liquid portions of
the foods.</p>

<p>The three stomachs of the cetaceans are similar to those of the
ruminants (Fig. 85). The first is a crop-like reservoir for the reception
of the food when swallowed. The mucous membrane is
entirely devoid of digestive glands. In the dolphins the mucous
membrane is provided with a hard horny covering, which serves
to break up the food mechanically by trituration. The second
stomach and the gut-like pyloric prolongation constituting the<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
third stomach contain gastric glands and are hence digestive in
function.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Stomach forms, in which a portion of the organ is converted
into an apparatus for mastication, are seen especially in birds, in
which animals, on account of the absence of teeth, mastication
cannot be performed in the mouth.</p>

<p>The stomach of the bird is usually composed of two segments,
one placed vertically above the other.</p>

<p>The first appears like an elongated dilatation of the &oelig;sophagus,
forming the <i>Proventriculus</i> or glandular stomach.</p>

<p>The second is larger, round in shape, with very strong and thick
muscular walls (Figs. 86 and 87).</p>

<p>The proventriculus furnishes the gastric juice exclusively.</p>

<p>The second or muscular stomach, devoid of gastric glands, functions
merely as a masticating apparatus for the mechanical division
of the food. The thick muscular walls of this compartment may
measure several inches in diameter and carry on the opposed mucous
surfaces lining the cavity a hard horny plate with corrugated
and roughened surface (Fig. 88). These hard plates are designed
to crush the food between them, as between two mill stones.
The muscle stomach is best developed in herbivorous birds, while
both the muscular wall and the horny plate are much weaker
and thinner in carnivore wading and swimming birds (Fig.
89).</p>

</div>

<p>In birds of prey, especially in the owls, the stomach walls are
scarcely more massive than in other animals, and the mucous
membrane is soft and devoid of a horny covering. The glandular
and masticatory stomachs are less sharply divided from each other
in these forms, and the entire organ conforms more to the general
vertebrate type (Fig. 90).</p>

<p>In some birds (herons, storks, etc.) a small rounded third
stomach, the so-called pyloric stomach, is placed between the
muscle stomach and the pylorus (Fig. 91). It contains no gastric
glands, and possibly may function as an additional absorbing
chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span></p>
<p>Among reptiles the stomach of the crocodile resembles the organ
in birds (Fig. 92). It is flat and rounded in shape, the muscle wall
carries a tendinous plate, and there is a pyloric stomach. There
is, however, no glandular stomach or proventriculus, as in birds,
and the mucous membrane is not covered by a horny plate, but
is soft and contains the peptic glands. Figs. 93 and 94 show the
stomach of <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, in the ventral view and in

<p>There are here two large reservoirs, which correspond to the

containing gastric glands, which corresponds to the
ruminant abomasum, and is connected by an &oelig;sophageal gutter
directly with the &oelig;sophagus. At the pyloric extremity the muscle
wall is greatly increased and the mucous membrane of this portion
carries a thick horny covering, forming a masticatory stomach
greatly resembling the corresponding structure in the bird. Its
function is evidently to complete the mechanical division of the
food which has only been partly masticated in the mouth.</p>

<p>The same significance is probably to be attached to the thickened
muscular walls which the pyloric segment of the stomach in

<h3>INTESTINE.</h3>

<p>Continuing our consideration of the development of the alimentary
canal we find that changes from the simple primitive
straight tube below the stomach depend upon two factors:</p>

<p>1. The increase in the length of the intestinal tube, which exceeds
relatively the increase in the length of the body cavity in
which it is contained.</p>

<p>2. The differentiation into small and large intestine, the development
of the cæcum and ileo-cæcal junction, and the development
of the accessory digestive glands, liver and pancreas, by budding<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
from the proximal portion of the primitive entodermal intestinal
tube.</p>

</div>

<p>1. In embryos up to 5&nbsp;mm. cervico-coccygeal measure (Fig.
97) the intestinal tube follows the body curve without deviation.
Subsequently the elongation of the intestine causes a
small bend, with the convexity directed ventrad, to appear in
the umbilical region. This bend gradually increases until the
gut forms a single long loop, beginning a short distance below the
pylorus and directed ventro-caudad. The apex of the loop, to
which the vitello-intestinal duct is attached (Fig. 98) (cf. <a href="#Page_34">p.&nbsp;34</a>)
projects beyond the abdominal cavity into the hollow of the
umbilical cord, constituting the so-called &ldquo;umbilical or embryonal
intestinal hernia.&rdquo; This entrance of the apex of the intestinal
umbilical loop into the umbilical cord begins in embryos of about
10&nbsp;mm. During the succeeding weeks&mdash;up to the tenth&mdash;the
segment of the intestine thus lodged within the hollow of the
umbilical cord increases. After this period the intestinal coils
are gradually withdrawn within the abdomen. The explanation
of this temporary extrusion of the intestine into the umbilical
cord is probably to be found in the strain produced by the yolk-sac
which is attached by the vitello-intestinal duct to the apex of
the umbilical loop. As we have seen (<a href="#Page_35">p.&nbsp;35</a>) the site of the
original apex of the loop may still be indicated in the adult by
the persistence of a portion of the vitello-intestinal duct as a
&ldquo;Meckel&rsquo;s diverticulum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In its simplest primitive condition the loop presents a proximal,
descending or efferent limb, an apex, and an ascending, returning
or afferent limb (Fig. 98). In the human embryo these segments
of the loop furnish the jejuno-ileum and portions of the large
intestine, in a manner to be subsequently detailed.</p>

<p>This stage in the development of the higher vertebrate intestine
is well illustrated by the alimentary tract of the mud-puppy, <i>Necturus
maculatus</i>, shown in <a href="#Fig_99">Fig. 99</a>, which represents the entire
situs viscerum of an adult female animal.</p>

<p>The stomach is tubular, not distinctly differentiated from the<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
&oelig;sophagus, placed vertically in the long axis of the body. The
pyloric end is marked by a constriction separating stomach from
midgut and immediately beyond this point the pancreas is applied
to the intestine. The rest of the intestinal canal forms a
simple loop, the descending limb presenting one or two primitive
convolutions. There is no marked differentiation between large
and small intestine, the canal possessing a nearly uniform caliber
from pylorus to cloaca.</p>

<p>2. The differentiation of the small from the large intestine,
marked by the appearance of the cæcal bud or protrusion (<a href="#Fig_100">Fig.
100</a>), takes place in the ascending segment of the umbilical loop
a short distance from the apex. In the human embryo the
cæcal bud appears in the 6th week as a plainly marked protuberance,
which grows very slowly in length and circumference.
It shows very early an unequal rate of development; the
terminal piece, not keeping pace in growth with the proximal
portion, is converted into the vermiform appendix, while the
proximal segment develops into the cæcum proper. The
increase in the length of the loop, which begins to be marked
in the 7th week, is not uniform. The apex is the first portion to
present the evidences of this growth. Subsequently the descending
limb grows in length very rapidly and is early thrown into
numerous coils of the future mobile portion of the small intestine
(jejuno-ileum). Even before the withdrawal of the apex of the
loop within the abdominal cavity a prominent coil of these convolutions
is found protruding in the umbilical region (<a href="#Fig_544">Fig. 544</a>).
The ascending limb of the loop from which a portion of the large
intestine is developed, grows comparatively slowly at this time.</p>

</div>

<p>The future portions of the human adult alimentary tract below
the stomach may be referred, in reference to their derivation, to
this primitive condition of the tube as follows:</p>

<p>1. The segment of small intestine situated between the pylorus
and the beginning or point of departure of the proximal or descending
limb of the umbilical loop, develops into the <i>duodenum</i>.
This portion of the small intestine is indicated early in embryos<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
of 2.15&nbsp;mm. (Fig. 101), by the origin of the hepatic duct from
the intestinal tube. Somewhat later, in embryos of 4.10-5&nbsp;mm.
length, (Fig. 102) it becomes additionally marked by the origin
of the pancreatic diverticulum. The duodenum, at first straight,
now begins to curve, forming a short <i>duodenal loop</i> or <i>bend</i>. In
embryos of 6 weeks the duodenum forms a simple loop placed
transversely below the pyloric extremity of the stomach (Figs.
103 and 104).</p>

<p>2. The descending limb, the apex and a small part of the ascending
limb of the umbilical loop form the jejuno-ileum.</p>

<p>3. The remainder of the ascending limb forms the cæcum and
appendix, the ascending and transverse colon.</p>

<p>4. The distal straight portion of the primitive tube forms the
terminal portion of the transverse colon (the splenic flexure), the
descending colon, sigmoid flexure and rectum.</p>

<p>The primitive condition of the embryonal mammalian alimentary
tract, after differentiation of the large intestine is well illustrated
by some of the lower vertebrates in which development
never proceeds beyond this stage. <a href="#Fig_112">Fig. 112</a> shows the entire alimentary
canal of a teleost fish, the conger eel (<i>Echelus conger</i>)
isolated.</p>

<p>The preparation forms a good illustration of the embryonal
stage of the higher vertebrates in which development has not
proceeded beyond the formation of the simple umbilical loop,
about corresponding to the schematic <a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a>. The stomach is
differentiated both by its caliber and by the formation of a
pyloric ring valve.</p>

<p>The midgut forms a simple loop with a descending and ascending
limb closely bound together by mesenteric attachment. Different
from the course of development followed in the human
embryo is the situation of the ileo-colic junction. The same appears
in the terminal straight segment of the canal&mdash;corresponding
to the human descending colon&mdash;while in the human embryo
the differentiation of small and large intestine takes place in the
course of the ascending limb of the loop. This condition de<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>pends
upon the relatively much shorter extent of the teleost
endgut compared with the human large intestine. Other examples
are afforded by the alimentary tract of some of the
Amphibia and Reptilia. <a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a> shows the alimentary canal
of <i>Rana catesbiana</i>, the common bull frog. The stomach, fairly
well differentiated, is succeeded by the small intestine of considerable
length and uniform caliber. The proximal portion of the
small intestine is characterized as duodenum by its connection
with liver and pancreas. In the remaining portion of the intestinal
canal it is not difficult to recognize the elements of the
umbilical loop of the higher mammalian embryo. The larger
mass of the jejuno-ileal coils is developed from the descending
limb of the loop; a smaller number of convolutions belong to the
returning or ascending limb, which also includes the ileo-colic
junction. The very short large intestine of the frog passes straight
down to enter the cloaca. Another example, in which the early
embryonal stages of the higher mammalia are illustrated by the
permanent structure of one of the lower vertebrates, is given in
<a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a>, which shows the alimentary tract of a chelonian, <i>Pseudemys
elegans</i>, the pond turtle. The bilobed liver fits over the
well-differentiated stomach in the manner of a saddle. The
stomach itself, as in chelonians generally, has a markedly transverse
position and passes under cover of the right lobe of the
liver into the duodenum. The coils of small intestine form a
prominent mass, which, however, when unravelled as shown in
the figure, permits us to recognize its identity with the mammalian
embryonic umbilical loop. The well-marked ileo-colic junction
is situated at the termination of the returning limb of the
loop, close to the beginning of the descending limb. This close
approximation of the duodenum and colon (duodeno-colic isthmus)
forms one of the most important factors in the further
development of the mammalian intestinal canal and will again
be referred to below.</p>

<p>From the ileo-colic junction the large intestine of the turtle continues
caudad to the cloaca in a nearly straight line. The same<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
primitive condition of the intestinal canal may be observed in
some members of man&rsquo;s own class, the mammalia&mdash;as in certain
edentates. Figs. 107 and <a href="#Fig_108">108</a> show the entire abdominal portion
of the alimentary tract in <i>Tamandua bivittata</i>, the little ant-eater
of Brazil. The stomach is turned cephalad and the great
omentum elevated. The intestines are turned over to the right
side.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in spite of the numerous coils of the
small intestine the general arrangement of the alimentary canal
corresponds to the primitive scheme shown in <a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a>. The entire
intestinal canal is attached by a continuous vertical mesentery to
the dorsal median line of the abdominal cavity ventrad of the
vertebral column and aorta. The growth in length of the small
intestine has necessitated a corresponding lengthening of the attached
border of the mesentery&mdash;consequently the membrane
presents a pleated or crenated appearance. The cæcum is well
developed, the ileo-cæcal junction being situated within the returning
limb of the loop, a little distance from the apex.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_109">Figs. 109</a> and <a href="#Fig_110">110</a>, taken from the same specimens, the entire
mass of the small intestines has been turned to the left so as
to exhibit the right leaf of the common dorsal mesentery and the
mesoduodenum, the latter containing the head of the pancreas. It
will be noted that the mesentery, expanding beyond the duodeno-colic
isthmus, is common to the small and to the proximal portion
of the large intestine, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, to those segments of the alimentary
canal which are developed from the two limbs of the umbilical
loop. Figs. 107-<a href="#Fig_110">110</a> should be studied and compared together, as
each supplements the others.</p>

<p>It will be observed, in reference to the change from the primitive
loop to the subsequent increase in the length of the tube and
the resulting arrangement of the mesentery, that three successive
stages are to be considered, represented schematically in <a href="#Fig_111">Fig.
111</a>. In the earliest stage (<a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 111</a>, I.) the two segments of the
loop are of equal length, parallel to one another, the distance between
the beginning and termination of the loop (1-2) being<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
maintained throughout its extent. Hence the mesentery is of
equal width in all its parts within the loop, only drawn out, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
away from the vertebral column, in accordance with the length
of the loop. In the next stage (<a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 111</a>, II.) the increase in the
length of the intestine is accompanied by a corresponding widening
of the mesentery. The points 1 and 2 are still approximately
the same distance apart as in the earlier stage, but the increase in
the length of the tube between these points forces the two limbs of
the loop to abandon their early parallel course, and to form
curved lines with the concavity turned toward the mesenteric
attachment. In this condition the mesentery consequently forms
a widely expanded membrane framed by the intestine and narrowing
between the points 1 and 2 to a neck or isthmus which
effects the transition between the expanded segment surrounded
by the intestine and the rest of the dorsal primitive mesentery.
Finally in the stage represented in <a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 111</a>, III., the increase
in the length of the small intestine has reached a point where a
single curve is no longer sufficient for the accommodation of the
growth. Consequently the tube now appears coiled and convoluted,
and the mesentery, as it is attached to the gut, of necessity
follows all the twists and appears fluted or pleated in its distal attached
portion.</p>

<p>If we now carefully examine the conditions presented by the
intestine and mesentery in a form like <i>Tamandua</i> (Figs. 107 and
108) we will find that they correspond to the developmental facts
thus far considered. The termination of the duodenum (1) and
the bend in the colon (2) mark the two points at which in the
primitive schema (<a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 111</a>, I.) the umbilical loop begins and terminates.
The proximal of these two points (1) corresponds to the
termination of the duodenum, which segment extends from here
cephalad to the pyloric extremity of the stomach. The distal
point (2) is placed on the colon where the returning limb of the
loop resumes the original median vertical course of the large intestine.
These two points mark the neck of the loop, which we
can describe as the <i>duodeno-colic neck</i> or <i>isthmus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span></p>

<p>The same condition is well shown in the intestinal canal of the
snapping turtle (<a href="#Fig_113">Fig. 113</a>). The duodenum and colon approach
each other very closely at the isthmus and between these points
the convolutions of the intestine extend in a wide circle. We
will find this approximation of duodenum and colon a feature
which persists throughout all the later developmental stages of
the higher vertebrates and has an important bearing on the final
arrangement of the intestinal canal in the human adult.</p>

Tube.</b>&mdash;The next important stage leading up to the final adult disposition
of the intestine in man and the higher mammals is the
<i>rotation</i> of the portions developed from the two limbs of the primitive
loop around an oblique axis drawn from the duodeno-colic
isthmus to the apex of the loop. The portion of the large intestine,
developed from the ascending limb of the loop, moves
in the third month to the middle line, coming into contact with
the ventral abdominal wall. From here the large intestine passes,
ventrad of the jejuno-ileal coils, toward the cephalic end of the
abdominal cavity and lies transversely along the greater curvature
of the stomach. The growing coils of the small intestine
crowd the colon more and more cephalad. In the fourth month
the cæcum turns to the right, coming into contact with the
caudal surface of the liver, ventrad of the duodenum, and subsequently
reaches the ventral surface of the right kidney. As the
result of this rotation the ileo-colic junction, cæcum and succeeding
portion of the colon are carried from the original position in
the distal and left part of the abdomen cephalad and to the right
across the proximal (duodenal) portion of the small intestine,
while the coils of the jejuno-ileum, developed from the descending
limb and apex of the loop, are turned in the opposite direction,
caudad and to the left underneath the preceding (<a href="#Fig_114">Figs. 114</a> and
<a href="#Fig_115">115</a>). This change in the relative position of the parts of the
intestinal tract and the resulting altered bearing of the colon to<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
the duodenum will be best appreciated by considering in the first
place the effect of the change on the arrangement of the primitive
mesentery and the intestinal vessels, and secondly by repeating
actually the rotation in the intestinal tract of a mammal
(cat) in which the adult arrangement of the intestine and peritoneum
permits us to perform the manipulations and note the
result.</p>

<p><b>I. Effect of Rotation on the Disposition of the Primitive Mesentery
and on the Relative Position of Duodenum and Colon, and Consequent
Arrangement of the Intestinal Blood Vessels.</b>&mdash;It will be appreciated
that in <a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 111</a>, representing a profile view of the original arrangement,
or in <a href="#Fig_107">Figs. 107</a> and <a href="#Fig_108">108</a>, showing the intestinal canal
of <i>Tamandua</i>, the left layer of the primitive mesentery is turned
toward the observer. The membrane is seen to pass from the ventral
aspect of the vertebral column and aorta, through the narrow
neck of the duodeno-colic isthmus, to expand in the manner already
indicated toward its intestinal attachment. In the rotation
of the intestine the twist takes place at the duodeno-colic neck,
carrying, as already stated, the large intestine cephalad and to the
right, while the jejuno-ileum is turned in the opposite direction
caudad and to the left. During this rotation the duodeno-jejunal
angle (Figs. 114, <i>B</i> and 115, <i>A</i>) passes to the left underneath the
proximal segment of the colon, which now lies ventrad and to
the right of the duodenal portion of the small intestine. The
mesenteric peritoneum, occupying the bight of the umbilical loop,
will, after the rotation, in the left profile view shown in <a href="#Fig_104">Fig.
104</a>, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, turn its original right leaf toward the beholder,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, toward the left, while the original left leaf is turned toward
the right.</p>

<p>Observation of the difference in the position of the ileo-colic
junction will still further accentuate the change in the relative
position of the parts which has been effected by the rotation. In
the primitive condition shown in <a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a>, <i>A</i>, the ileum enters
the large intestine from right to left, and the concavity of the
cæcal bud turns its crescentic margin ventrad and to the right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span></p>

<p>After rotation is accomplished (<a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, and Fig.
115) the ileo-colic entrance takes place in the opposite direction,
from left to right and the cæcum turns its concave margin caudad
and to the left.</p>

<p>Figs. 116 and <a href="#Fig_117">117</a> show the intestinal tract of <i>Tamandua bivittata</i>
arranged so as to correspond to the human embryonic condition
after rotation. The cæcum has been brought up and to the right
across the proximal duodenal portion of the small intestine, while
the jejuno-ileal coils have been turned down and to the left. The
rotation has been accomplished by a twist at the duodeno-colic
isthmus, and the original right leaf of the mesentery has become
the left and <i>vice versa</i>. Comparison with <a href="#Fig_107">Figs. 107</a> and <a href="#Fig_108">108</a>, representing
the condition before rotation in the same animal, will
indicate the changes which have been accomplished by imitating
the course of development followed in the higher mammals.</p>

<p>Failure of rotation and arrest of development at the primitive
stage, with consequent persistent embryonic condition of the
mesentery, occurs occasionally in man. Such cases have been
reported by W. J. Walsham, in St. Barthol. Hosp. Rep., London,
Vol. 16. The following four instances of this condition, taken
from the Columbia University museum, will illustrate the disposition
of the abdominal contents.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_118">Fig. 118</a> shows the arrangement of the abdominal viscera in
an adult female body. Beginning at the pyloric extremity of the
stomach the entire course of the duodenum can be overlooked and
its continuation into the jejuno-ileal division traced. The small
intestines occupy the ventral and right part of the cavity. The
ileo-colic junction is placed in the lower left-hand corner of the
abdomen and the small intestine enters the large from right to
left, the ascending colon is situated to the left of the median line
and at its point of transition into the segment representing the
transverse colon is connected by several adhesions with the ventral
surface of the duodenum. The transverse colon, folded into
several coils bound together by adhesion, occupies the upper left
portion of the abdomen.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a>, taken from the same specimen, shows the entire mass
of intestines lifted up and turned to the left, exposing the background
of the abdominal cavity lined by parietal peritoneum.
The duodenum is still entirely free and non-adherent to the
parietal peritoneum. The continuity of the mesoduodenum with
the jejuno-ileal mesentery is well shown. The primitive right
leaf of the mesentery is turned to the observer. This layer after
completed rotation would form the left layer of the adult mesentery
of the jejuno-ileum.</p>

<p>Fig. 120 illustrates another instance of the same condition in
the adult. In this case the duodenum was coiled twice upon itself
and adherent to the prerenal parietal peritoneum.</p>

<p>Fig. 121, presenting the same adhesion of the duodenum, illustrates
very perfectly the persistence of the narrow duodeno-colic
isthmus in cases of non-rotation, as well as the development of
the different segments of the adult tract from the limbs of the
embryonal umbilical intestinal loop.</p>

<p>It will be observed that beyond the duodeno-colic isthmus the
coils of the jejuno-ileum have resulted from the increase in length
of the descending limb, the apex and the proximal part of the
ascending or recurrent limb, carrying the ileo-colic junction and
cæcum. The remainder of the ascending limb, terminating in
the embryonic condition at the splenic flexure by passing into
the descending colon, has in the course of further development
in this individual produced a straight segment&mdash;the misplaced
ascending colon&mdash;and a convoluted and bent representative of
the normal transverse colon.</p>

<p>The same disposition of the large intestine may be noted in the
other preparations.</p>

<p>Fig. 122 shows an instance of non-rotation observed in the human
infant at two years of age.</p>

<p>Fig. 123, taken from a f&oelig;tus at term, shows the result of failure
to completely rotate in the region of the cæcum and ileo-colic
junction. The rest of the large intestine has rotated as usual and
assumed the normal position. The terminal ileum, however,<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
passes behind the cæcum and enters the large intestine on its
right side; the cæcum is turned upwards and to the right and
the appendix lies ventrad of the beginning of the ascending
colon. In order to produce the normal arrangement, shown in
Fig. 124, taken from another f&oelig;tus at term, it would be necessary
to turn the cæcum and ileo-colic junction in Fig. 123 through
half a circle. The cæcum would then turn upwards and to the
left, the ileum entering the large intestine from left to right, and
the appendix would be placed behind the cæcum and ileo-colic
junction. Figs. 125 and 126 show the normal and abnormal
arrangement presented by these two preparations diagrammatically.
The instances in which in the adult the ileo-colic entrance
is placed on the right side of the large intestine and in which
the appendix is situated laterad of the ascending colon unquestionably
find their explanation in the failure of the intestine to
completely rotate at the ileo-colic junction.</p>

<p>The resulting conditions are shown in Figs. 127 and 128, taken
from adult human subjects in which the final stage of rotation of
the large intestine has not taken place.</p>

<p>In Fig. 127 the terminal ileum is sharply bent on itself and
adherent to the prerenal parietal peritoneum. It passes from
right to left and downwards to enter the right posterior circumference
of the large intestine. The cæcum is turned cephalad and
the appendix is in contact with the right lobe of the liver. The
cæcum passes with a sharp bend into the obliquely directed ascending
colon.</p>

<p>In Fig. 128 the ileum enters the colon from the right and
below. The apex of the cæcum is turned cephalad and to
the right and the appendix extends beneath peritoneal adhesions
along the lateral border of the proximal segment of the
colon.</p>

<p>In the next place it is desirable to clearly understand the vascular
supply of the intestine before and after rotation and the
final relation of the superior mesenteric artery to the transverse
portion of the duodenum.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Development of Aortal Arterial System.</b></p>

<p>The thoracic and abdominal aortæ are at first double, the first
aortic arches continuing as so-called &ldquo;primitive aortæ&rdquo; ventrad
of the vertebral column to the caudal end of the body.</p>

<p>The cephalic portions of the two vessels unite in the chick on
the third day and from this point fusion into a single vessel proceeds
slowly caudad.</p>

<p>In the rabbit the fusion of the primitive aortæ begins on the
ninth day in the region of the lung-buds and progresses from here
caudad until by the sixteenth day a single aorta is formed (Fig.
129).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 410px;">

<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_129"></a>Fig. 129.</span>&mdash;Diagrams illustrating the arrangement of the primitive heart
and aortic arches. (After Heisler, modified from Allen Thompson.)
</div>

<p>That the entire descending aorta in man results from the fusion
of two vessels is shown by the rare cases in which the aorta is
divided throughout its entire length by a septum.</p>

<p>The arteries of the allantois are originally the terminations of
the primitive aortæ. After fusion of the primitive aortæ to form
the abdominal aorta the allantoic arteries, now passing as the umbilical
arteries to the placenta, appear as the branches of bifurcation
of the abdominal aorta, in the same way as the common iliacs
do in the adult.</p>

<p>They furnish branches, which at first are very small, to the
budding posterior extremities and the pelvic viscera. In time
these rudiments of the future external and internal iliac arteries
become larger, but as the umbilical arteries continue to develop
throughout the entire intra-uterine period they appear even in
the f&oelig;tus at term as end branches of the aorta, a condition which
is only changed after birth by the obliteration of the umbilical
arteries and their conversion into the lateral ligaments of the
bladder, while the iliac vessels now appear as the terminal aortic
branches. The statement that the umbilical arteries appear as
the terminal branches of the embryonal aorta requires to be modified
in the following respect:</p>

<p>When the allantois develops its arteries are in fact end-branches
of the two primitive aortæ. After their fusion and
after the formation of the single aorta this vessel is continued be<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>yond
the umbilical arteries as a small trunk, the caudal artery or
rudiment of the adult sacralis media. Consequently the umbilical
arteries are really lateral branches of a median vessel, viz., aorta
abdominalis and arteria sacralis media. But as the umbilical vessels
are very large and the caudal aorta very small, the former,
even under these conditions, appear as the real terminal branches
of the abdominal aorta.</p>

<p>The arteries supplying the yolk-sac and subsequently the intestinal
canal are the vitelline or omphalo-mesenteric. At first they
are branches derived from the two primitive aortæ, and after the
fusion of these vessels they arise from the resulting single abdominal
aorta. The omphalo-mesenteric arteries are at first multiple
and later are reduced to two. When the primitive intestine loses
its original close contact with the vertebral column and the common
dorsal mesentery develops, the two omphalo-mesenteric arteries
unite to form a single vessel, running between the layers of
the mesentery. After a short course this artery divides again into
two branches, passing one on each side, around the intestinal tube,
which has in the meanwhile become closed. Ventrad of the intestine
these branches reunite so that the gut is surrounded by a
vascular circle. The left half of this loop becomes obliterated
and the trunk of the omphalo-mesenteric artery now passes on
the right side of the intestine to the umbilicus. The peripheral
segment of the omphalo-mesenteric artery disappears with the
cessation of the vitelline circulation. The proximal portion, situated
between the layers of the mesentery, gives numerous anastomosing
branches to the intestine and is converted into the main
trunk of the superior mesenteric artery.</p>

<p>The derivation of the superior mesenteric as the fully developed
proximal segment of the embryonic omphalo-mesenteric artery
passing to the yolk-sac is responsible for the rare anomaly in the
adult of a branch of the superior mesenteric artery continuing
beyond the intestine to the umbilicus. I have encountered one
instance of this persistence of the intra-abdominal portion of the
omphalo-mesenteric artery in a male subject 54 years of age. A<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
connective strand, containing a small artery derived from
the superior mesenteric vessels, extended between the right layer
of the mesentery, some distance from its attached border, and
the ventral abdominal wall at the umbilicus. The vessel which
was pervious throughout, was the size of one of the digital arteries.</p>

<p>Hyrtl has observed the same variation. An example of partial
persistence of the omphalo-mesenteric artery in the adult is
well seen in the case of Meckel&rsquo;s diverticulum shown in <a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>,
where the arterial vessel continued upon the diverticulum represents
the embryonic omphalo-mesenteric artery.</p>

<p>The remaining intestinal arteries are at first more numerous and
paired. In man and most mammals they are early reduced in
number, passing from the abdominal aorta to the dorsal or attached
border of the intestine, between the two peritoneal layers of the
primitive dorsal mesentery (<a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a>). The arterial blood supply
of the intestinal canal then presents three general divisions:</p>

<p>1. Vessels pass from the proximal part of the abdominal aorta to
the stomach and pyloric portion of the duodenum. This set of
vessels forms the rudiment of the future c&oelig;liac axis. With the
development of the liver and pancreas by budding from the duodenum,
and with the appearance of the spleen in the mesoderm
of the dorsal mesentery, branches corresponding to these organs
(hepatic and splenic arteries) are added to the gastric and duodenal
vessels and the adult arrangement of the c&oelig;liac axis is thus
obtained (Figs. 130, 131, 132 and 133).</p>

<p>These vessels have an important bearing on the formation of
the adult peritoneal cavity in the retro-gastric space, and will be
considered in detail below with that portion of the subject.</p>

<p>2. The next vessel in order derived from the aorta and supplying
the duodenum, pancreas, the small and a part of the large intestine
is the above-mentioned superior mesenteric artery, which
arises from the aorta a short distance caudad of the c&oelig;liac axis
(Figs. 130, 131, 132 and 133).</p>

<p>At the time when the intestine still presents the primitive arrangement
of the umbilical loop (<a href="#Fig_104">Figs. 104</a> and <a href="#Fig_130">130</a>) this vessel<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
passes between the layers of the dorsal mesentery through the
narrow duodeno-colic neck to reach the two limbs and the apex
of the intestinal loop. In its course it gives off successively
branches to the gut from each side. Those from the right side
of the main vessel pass to the duodenum, pancreas, jejunum and
ileum. Those from the left side of the main vessel accede in
succession to the colic angle of the isthmus, the proximal portion
of the colon, the cæcum and the ileo-colic junction. The
terminal portion of the superior mesenteric artery supplies the
ileum near the ileo-colic entrance. After rotation it will be
found that the turn has occurred at the point <i>X</i> (<a href="#Fig_130">Fig. 130</a>),
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, in that part of the vessel which occupies the duodeno-colic
isthmus. Hence it will be found that the first branches
derived from the right side of the primitive superior mesenteric
artery, supplying the duodenum and pancreas (Art. pancreatico-duodenalis
inferior) still arise after rotation from the right side.
They are succeeded, beyond the point <i>X</i>, by the original highest
<i>left</i> branches passing to colon, cæcum and ileo-colic junction, while
all the original right-sided vessels, except the inferior pancreatico-duodenal,
appear now as branches from the left side of the main
artery, supplying the coils of the jejuno-ileum. Hence in the
adult (Fig. 133) the succession of branches derived from the
right or concave side of the superior mesenteric artery is as
follows:</p>

<p>On the other hand, the first branches from what has now become
the left or convex side of the vessel are the original lower
right-hand vessels to the small intestine developed from the descending
limb of the loop. Hence in the adult the left side
of the superior mesenteric vessel gives rise to the vasa intestini
tenuis.</p>

<p>3. The caudal intestinal arterial branch derived from the aorta<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>
is the inferior mesenteric artery supplying parts of the transverse
colon, the descending colon, sigmoid flexure and rectum <a href="#Fig_130">(Figs.
130</a>, <a href="#Fig_131">131</a>, <a href="#Fig_132">132</a>, and <a href="#Fig_133">133</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand in the cases of non-rotation of the intestine
as above described in <a href="#Fig_118">Figs. 118</a>-<a href="#Fig_122">122</a>, the embryonic type of the intestinal
arterial supply persists, as indicated schematically in Fig.
134. Not only the pancreatico-duodenalis inferior, but all the remaining
branches to the small intestine are derived from the right
side of the superior mesenteric artery. The terminal branches
of the main artery supply the ileo-colic junction, while the
arterial supply of the large intestine, A. colica dextra and media,
are given off from the left side of the parent vessel.</p>

<p><b>II. Demonstration of Intestinal Rotation in the Cat.</b>&mdash;The changes
in the relative position of the different intestinal segments and
the final disposition of the mesenteries and blood vessels can best
be understood by the direct examination of the abdominal contents
in an animal whose permanent adult arrangement corresponds
to one of the early embryonal human stages, and in
which the necessary manipulations can readily be carried out and
their results noted.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if the above detailed developmental stages in man
can ever be clearly comprehended unless the student will for
himself examine the conditions and perform the manipulations
in one of the lower mammals.</p>

<p>The necessity of keeping the three dimensions of space in mind
and the fact that certain structures during and after rotation cover
and obscure each other, make diagrams and drawings unsatisfactory
unless the actual examination of the object itself is combined
with their study. Fortunately, among the common domestic
animals of convenient size easily obtained the cat answers
every purpose of this study admirably. The student is earnestly
urged to pursue his study of the development and adult arrangement
of the human abdominal viscera and peritoneum in the
light which the anatomy of this animal can shed on the complicated
and obscure conditions encountered in the human subject.<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
The plan of having the opened abdominal cavity of the cat directly
side by side with the human subject, while the arrangement
of the abdominal viscera and peritoneum is considered, cannot be
recommended too highly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Directions.</span>&mdash;After killing the animal with chloroform the abdominal
cavity is to be freely opened by a cruciform incision and
the skin flaps turned well back and secured in this position. It
is well to select a male animal or an unimpregnated female, as the
size of the pregnant uterus in the later stages renders the examination
of the abdominal viscera and peritoneum more difficult.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 550px;">

<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_135"></a>Fig. 135.</span>&mdash;Abdominal viscera of cat; great omentum raised; intestines turned down and to

</div>

<p>For purposes of careful study and comparison of the vascular
relations of the abdomen, it is highly desirable to inject the animal
with differently colored gelatine, starch or plaster of Paris
mass. The arterial injection can be made through the carotid
artery, the systemic venous injection through the femoral vein,
and the portal circulation can be filled after opening the abdomen,
by injection through the superior mesenteric or splenic
veins. Animals prepared in this manner are especially useful
for the study of the upper portion of the abdominal cavity
and of the peritoneal relations of liver, stomach, spleen, pancreas
and duodenum. They may be kept for permanent reference
in a 5 per cent. solution of formaline or 50 per cent.
alcohol.</p>

<p>After opening the abdominal cavity turn the great omentum up
over the ventral surface of the thorax and secure it in this position,
thus exposing the underlying intestines completely (Fig.
135). Trace in the first place the entire course of the intestinal
tube from the pyloric extremity of the stomach down. It will be
noticed that the first portion of the small intestine (duodenum)
is freely movable, completely invested by peritoneum and attached
to the dorsal midline by a mesoduodenum between the layers of
which a portion of the pancreas is seen.</p>

<p>Following the duodenum caudad it will be observed that the
gut can be traced directly continuous with the remaining coils of
the small intestine. The ileo-colic junction and the beginning of<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
the large intestine are marked by a short pointed cæcum. The
large intestine is short, as it is in all carnivore mammals, and
passes from the cæcum almost directly down into the pelvis.</p>

<p>Take the cæcum and the first portion of the large intestine and
turn them caudad and over to the left side as far as the peritoneal
connections will permit.</p>

<p>Spread out the coils of the small intestine in the opposite direction,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, over to the right side.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the intestinal tract after these manipulations
should appear as shown in <a href="#Fig_136">Figs. 136</a> and <a href="#Fig_137">137</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be seen that all the essential features described for the
corresponding stage in the human embryo (<a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a>, <i>A</i>) exist
here. The proximal portion of the small intestine (duodenum)
retains its freedom and mobility, being attached to the ventral
surface of the vertebral column by the portion of the primitive
mesentery which now constitutes the mesoduodenum.
The gut itself forms a bend with the convexity turned to the
right.</p>

<p>Observe in the next place that the point (Fig. 136, <i>X</i>), where
small intestine and colon approach each other closely, marks the
situation of the f&oelig;tal duodeno-colic isthmus. The small intestine
at this point corresponds to the future duodeno-jejunal angle as
will be seen after rotation has been accomplished.</p>

<p>Recalling the development of the jejuno-ileum it will not be
difficult to recognize in the numerous coils of small intestine
which succeed to the duodeno-colic isthmus the results of the increase
in length of the descending or efferent limb of the human
embryonal umbilical loop. Tracing these coils it will be found
that the terminal portions of the ileum correspond to the apex and
to the proximal part of the ascending or recurrent limb of the
primitive loop, while the remainder of this limb furnishes the
cæcum and the next succeeding segment of the large intestine.
Following the tube up to this point the colic boundary of the duodeno-colic
isthmus will be reached; from here the short large intestine
of the carnivore descends straight into the pelvis, attached<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
to the ventral surface of the vertebral column by a mesocolon
which corresponds to the distal part of the original primitive
dorsal mesentery.</p>

<p>Now with the parts still in this position examine carefully the
arrangement of the mesentery and of the intestinal blood vessels.
Starting with the duodenum it will be seen that the primitive
sagittal mesentery of this portion of the intestine has followed the
gut in its turn to the right, so that the original right layer of the
sagittal membrane is now directed dorsad and lies in contact with
the parietal peritoneum which invests the background of the abdominal
cavity in the right lumbar region below the liver and
covers the ventral surface of the right kidney. Beneath this
parietal peritoneum the inferior vena cava is seen, receiving the
right renal vein and ascending to enter the dorso-caudal aspect
of the right lobe of the liver. If now we assume that in the
cat the opposed serous surfaces of the original right leaf of the
mesoduodenum, now directed dorsad, and of the parietal peritoneum
adhere to each other, and that the visceral peritoneum
covering the dorsal surface of the descending duodenum likewise
becomes obliterated by adhesion to the subjacent parietal peritoneum,
we will obtain the arrangement found in the adult
human subject, in which the descending duodenum is fixed by
adhesion below the right lobe of the liver and ventrad of the
medial portion of right kidney, right renal vein and inferior vena
cava. During this process of anchoring the head of the pancreas,
which is found between the two layers of the free mesoduodenum
of the cat, would also become fixed to the abdominal background
by adhesion of the original right leaf of the mesoduodenum, investing
what has now become the dorsal surface of the pancreas, to
the parietal peritoneum. The original left layer of the primitive
mesoduodenum would then appear as <i>secondary</i> parietal peritoneum
covering what has now become the ventral surface of the
transversely disposed head of the gland. The stages may be
represented schematically in <a href="#Fig_138">Figs. 138</a>-<a href="#Fig_140">140</a>.</p>

<p>Figs. 138 and 139 shows the arrangement in the cat where a<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
free duodenum and mesoduodenum exists, with the pancreas
included between its layers.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>It will be noticed that the duodenum in the cat can be carried
over to the median line (Fig. 138) exposing the entire ventral
aspect of the right kidney and the inferior vena cava beneath the
primary lumbar parietal peritoneum. This manipulation will
also expose the dorsal surface of the head of the pancreas, covered
by what originally was the right leaf of the mesoduodenum.</p>

<p>Fig. 140 indicates the results of adhesion of the duodenum,
pancreas and mesoduodenum to the parietal peritoneum as it
normally occurs in the human subject. It will be seen that
the primary parietal peritoneum can be traced mesad over the
ventral surface of the right kidney as far as the point <i>X</i>, and
that from here on to the median line the peritoneum is <i>secondary</i>
parietal peritoneum, consisting of the visceral peritoneal
investment of the ventral surface of the duodenum and of the
original left leaf of the mesoduodenum, beneath which the ventral
surface of the pancreas is seen. Pancreas and duodenum
occupy in the adult secondarily a &ldquo;retro-peritoneal&rdquo; position, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
the peritoneum now covering the ventral surface of these viscera
appears as a continuation of the parietal peritoneum, the transition
between primary and secondary parietal peritoneum occurring
along the line marked <i>X</i> in Fig. 140. The opposed peritoneal
surfaces indicated by the dotted lines have become adherent
and converted into loose connective tissue in which the
pancreas and duodenum lie imbedded. In the human embryo
this process of adhesion begins in the eighth week, starting at the
duodeno-jejunal flexure and ascending gradually toward the
pylorus. At the end of the fourth month the union is complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span></p>

<p>Proceeding caudad it will next be observed that the peritoneum
of the mesentery occupies the narrow neck of the duodeno-colic
isthmus, and that large vessels (the superior mesenteric) pass between
its two layers at this point to supply the segments of the
intestine forming the loop. In conformity with the greatly increased
length of the intestine it will be found that the mesentery
expands from the narrow pedicle at the neck in a fan-shaped
manner in order to develop a sufficiently long margin for attachment
to the intestine. The following points should be carefully
borne in mind in studying the mesentery with the intestines in
this position:</p>

<p>1. The mesentery presents two free surfaces, right and left.
With the coils of the small intestine turned over to the right, the
left leaf of the mesentery is turned toward the observer.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 470px;">
<img src="images/fig141.jpg" width="470" height="356" alt="" />
<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_141"></a>Fig. 141.</span>&mdash;Schematic representation of mesentery of umbilical loop, common to small
intestine and proximal portion of large intestine.
</div>

<p>2. Inasmuch as the descending limb of the embryonic loop has
developed the greater part of the small intestine, while a portion
of the large intestine (cæcum and colon up to the isthmus) is the
result of differentiation within the ascending or returning limb of
the loop, it will be at once apparent that the double peritoneal
layer which extends between the duodeno-colic isthmus and the
attached border of the gut is partly mesentery of the small intestine,
partly mesocolon passing to the large intestine (cæcum
and proximal colon). This condition may be indicated schematically
in Fig. 141.</p>

<p>The curved line <i>A</i> may be taken as an arbitrary division between
the portion of the membrane which on the right of the figure
passes to the small intestine, and the portion which proceeds to
the left to be attached to the large intestine. In other words the
line will schematically separate the true mesenteric from the mesocolic
segment of the primitive membrane.</p>

<p>With the parts in their present position this line might be assumed
to indicate a strip along which the opposed serous surfaces
of the parietal peritoneum and the right leaf of the primitive
mesentery became adherent. In that case an actual division into
a mesenteric and mesocolic segment would have been effected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span></p>

<p>Ventrad and to the right of this line of adhesion we would trace
that portion of the primitive membrane which now passes to the
coils of the small intestine as the true mesentery, having an apparent
origin in the background of the abdomen to the dotted line
of adhesion. In the same manner the peritoneal layers passing
to the left to reach the cæcum and beginning of the colon would
appear as a free mesocolon with the same line of apparent origin
from the background of the abdomen. (cf. <a href="#Page_80">p.&nbsp;80</a>.)</p>

<p>These considerations should be followed out in the dissection of
the cat in order to become familiar with the principle of <i>secondary
lines of origin</i> for peritoneal layers. As we will see later this factor
is of importance in correctly estimating the value of the human
adult conditions.</p>

<p>3. A brief consideration of the mechanical conditions and comparison
with the earlier stages will show why the peritoneal layers
which occupy the bight of the fully developed umbilical loop are
especially prone to develop secondary lines and areas of adhesion
to other serous surfaces. If we compare the dorsal mesentery in
its primitive condition, before the straight intestinal tube has become
differentiated into the subsequent segments, and before the
umbilical loop has been formed (Fig. 142), with the later stages
represented by the intestines of the cat as now arranged (Figs.
143 and 144), it will be seen that the vertical line of attachment
to the ventral surface of the vertebral column, between the points
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> corresponds in the advanced stages to the interval <i>ab</i>
separating the two points of the duodeno-colic isthmus; also that
the entire mesenteric peritoneal surface beyond the isthmus is the
result of drawing out and lengthening the intestinal tract. Consequently
folding or overlapping of this extensive membrane
affords opportunities for adhesions between its own serous surfaces
or between it and the remaining visceral and parietal peritoneum
of the abdomen.</p>

<p>Moreover, it will be appreciated that the entire extensive coil
of intestines extending between the two boundaries of the duodeno-colic
isthmus (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) is suspended from the back part of the abdo<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>men
by a narrow pedicle and that consequently rotation will
readily occur around the axis drawn through the neck of the
isthmus.</p>

<p>Now proceed to illustrate on the cat the result of the rotation
as it occurs normally during the development of the primate intestinal
tract. Take the cæcum and commencement of the colon
and draw the same over to the right across the duodeno-colic
isthmus and the duodenum. Twist or rotate the entire mass of
small intestines around the isthmic pedicle, so that the original left
leaf of the mesentery will look to the right and <i>vice versa</i> (<a href="#Fig_145">Fig.
145</a>). The conditions thus established will be found to correspond
to the schemata shown in <a href="#Fig_114">Figs. 114</a> and <a href="#Fig_115">115</a>. The main features
of the intestinal tract in the rearranged position will be as follows:</p>

<p>1. The two points, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, of the duodeno-colic isthmus (Fig.
145) are still close together, but reversed in position, <i>b</i> is in front
and to the right, <i>a</i> behind and to the left, whereas before the rotation
<i>b</i> was situated below and to the left, <i>a</i> above and to the right
(<a href="#Fig_135">Fig. 135</a>).</p>

<p>2. The direction of the ileo-colic entrance is reversed, the ileum
now entering the large intestine from below and the left upwards
and to the right, instead of from right to left.</p>

<p>3. The descending duodenum is now situated dorsad to the colon.</p>

<p>4. The original left leaf of the mesentery has become the right,
and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>5. The superior mesenteric artery crosses over the transverse
portion of the duodenum, and with the exception of the inferior
pancreatico-duodenal artery the original right-sided branches now
arise from the left side of the vessel and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>It is now time to compare the conditions established in the cat
by the manipulations just detailed with the arrangement of the
adult human intestinal tract and peritoneum below the level of
the transverse colon and mesocolon.</p>

<p>I. The shortness of the large intestine in the cat will require
careful manipulation in order to produce a disposition in conformity
with the arrangement of this portion of the human intes<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>tinal
tract. By stretching the gut somewhat and pulling it well
out of the pelvis sufficient length will be obtained to establish an
ascending, transverse and descending colon. Move the cæcum
from the subhepatic position which it occupies immediately after
rotation (Fig. 145) down to the lower and right-hand corner of
the abdomen. Pull the distal portion of the large intestine well
out of the pelvis and obtain thus sufficient length to establish
an ascending, transverse and descending division each provided
with a free mesocolon (Fig. 146). In the formation of the three
definite main segments of the human large intestine, ascending,
transverse and descending colon, the following stages may be
recognized:</p>

</table>

<p>1. Immediately after rotation the large intestine lies transversely
along the greater curvature of the stomach, with the
cæcum on the right side in front of the duodenum and closely
applied to the caudal surface of the right lobe of the liver (Fig.
147).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Persistence of Subhepatic Position of Cæcum in Adult.</span>&mdash;The
period at which the cæcum descends into the iliac fossa is
liable to a considerable range of variation.</p>

<p>Treves found in two f&oelig;tus, measuring respectively 4&frac12;&#8243; and 5&frac12;&#8243;,
the cæcum on a level with the caudal end of the right kidney,
while in several individuals at full term the caput coli was still
placed immediately below the liver, with no large intestine in the
place of the ascending colon. This condition is well illustrated
in the f&oelig;tus shown in <a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>.</p>

<p>The cæcum may remain undescended throughout life. Treves,
in an examination of 100 bodies, found this condition in two subjects,
both females, one 41, the other 74 years of age. Both cases
presented an identical disposition. There was no large intestine
in the place of the ascending colon. The cæcum was placed on
the right side, immediately underneath the liver, just to the right
of the gall-bladder; it was quite horizontal in position, continuing
the long axis of the transverse colon and included between
the layers of the transverse mesocolon. From the extremity of<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
the cæcum a horizontal fold was continued to the abdominal
parietes and upon it the edge of the liver rested. In one of these
instances the colon from the tip of the cæcum to the splenic
flexure measured 38&#8243;. The great omentum was attached only to
the left half of this portion. The descending colon was very long,
measuring 15&#8243;.</p>

<p>In the other case the distance from the tip of the cæcum to the
splenic flexure was 27&#8243;, the great omentum commencing 5&#8243; from
the former point. The descending colon was of normal length.</p>

<p>In both bodies the remaining viscera were normal.</p>

<p>2. The cæcum next descends ventrad of right kidney to the
iliac fossa. The future ascending colon is at this time placed very
obliquely on account of the large size of the f&oelig;tal liver, and passes
without a marked angle into the transverse segment. Thus in
Fig. 148, from a f&oelig;tus 5&#8243; in length, the descending colon is vertical
and the splenic flexure well marked, forming the highest point
of the colic arch. There is no hepatic flexure, and no ascending
and transverse colon, but instead of these an oblique segment passing
upwards and to the left between cæcum and splenic flexure.</p>

<p>This disposition, due to the large size of the liver, is still marked
at times in the f&oelig;tus at term, and occasionally even in children
up to 2 or 3 years of age.</p>

<p>3. The ascending colon is subsequently differentiated from the
transverse segment and the hepatic flexure formed consequent
upon the diminution of the relative size of the liver, which permits
the f&oelig;tal oblique segment of the colon extending in the
earlier stages between the right iliac fossa and the spleen to become
divided by a right-angled (hepatic) bend or flexure into an

<p>4. The splenic flexure develops early and is well marked. It
indicates the point of transition of the original ascending limb
of the umbilical loop into the remaining vertical median segment
of the large intestine, from which the descending colon is formed.</p>

<p>In the adult the ascending and descending portions of the
colon are vertical. The transverse colon is not quite horizontal<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
since the splenic flexure is higher and placed more dorsally than
the hepatic flexure. In the embryo the rapidly-growing coils of
the small intestine push the descending colon to the left and
dorsad into close contact with the dorsal abdominal wall.</p>

<p>A small bend which appears about the middle of the third
month in the left iliac fossa indicates the rudiment of the future
sigmoid flexure or omega loop.</p>

<p>The rest of the endgut follows the body wall in a well-marked
curve, whose termination lies within the concavity of the caudal
portion of the embryo (Fig. 150). From this terminal part the
rectum develops after the division of the cloaca and the union of
the proctodæum with the entodermal intestinal pouch has taken
place as detailed above.</p>

<p>The early position of the colon produced by the large size of
the f&oelig;tal liver, and before the descent of the cæcum has occurred,
is shown in <a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>. In <a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a>, where the liver has regained
its normal proportions with reference to the abdominal cavity and
viscera, and the cæcum has descended into the right iliac fossa,
the hepatic flexure is well marked and the first segment of the
colon has acquired the vertical position on the right side, the
single obliquely transverse segment of <a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>, having become

</div>

<p>At times the transverse colon, whose normal average length in
the adult is 20&#8243;, greatly exceeds this measurement and forms an
arch which hangs down or makes a well-marked V-shaped bend
with the apex directed toward the pubes. This is the normal
arrangement of this portion of the large intestine in many of
the lower primates. Fig. 151 shows the abdominal viscera of<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
<i>Macacus rhesus</i>, hardened <i>in situ</i>, seen from the front and the
right side, with the omentum turned up over the stomach. The
transverse colon forms an extensive V-shaped bend, whose
apex reaches to the pubes, from which point the large intestine
turns again cephalad and dorsad to form the splenic flexure and
then descends to the pelvis.</p>

<p>The average length of the ascending colon in the adult, measured
from the tip of the cæcum to the hepatic flexure, was found
by Treves in his series of 100 bodies to be 8&#8243;, while the descending
colon, from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid
loop, measured 8&frac12;&#8243;.</p>

<p>The descending colon may at times be much longer, up to 15&#8243;,
and become convoluted.</p>

<p>II. In the next place, in order to understand the arrangement
of the peritoneum in this lower larger compartment of the abdomen,
disregard for the present the peritoneal connections of the
stomach, liver, pancreas and spleen, and the folds of the great
omentum entirely. This latter membrane is adherent in the
adult human subject by its dorsal surface to the upper margin of
the transverse colon, so that in turning the omentum up over
the ventral chest wall the transverse colon will be carried with
the omentum and the lower layer of the transverse mesocolon
will be put upon the stretch. This membrane forms in adult man
by its transverse attachment to the abdominal background the
cephalic limit of the larger lower compartment of the abdomen,
which is framed laterally by ascending and descending colon, continuous
below with the pelvic cavity and occupied chiefly by the
freely movable coils of the jejuno-ileum.</p>

<p>Remember that the duodenum starting from the pyloric extremity
of the stomach first turns cephalad and dorsad in contact
with the caudal surface of the right lobe of the liver, forming the
first portion or hepatic angle of the duodenum; that in the next
place the second or descending portion of the duodenum passes
down in front of the medial part of the ventral surface of the
right kidney and the inferior vena cava, but <i>behind</i> the right ex<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>tremity
(hepatic flexure) of what after rotation and formation of
the ascending colon appears as the transverse colon; that consequently
the descending duodenum is divided by its intersection
with the transverse colon into a cephalic supra-colic and a caudal
infra-colic segment.</p>

<p>Also remember that the second angle of the duodenum (transition
between the descending and transverse portions) is consequently
situated to the right of the vertebral column below the
level of the transverse colon and the secondary attachment presently
to be considered of the transverse mesocolon to the background
of the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p>The third portion of the duodenum extends from this point
more or less transversely&mdash;depending upon the type&mdash;to the left,
across the vertebral column and aorta. This transverse portion,
after the rotation of the primitive loop at the duodeno-colic angle,
is crossed in the direction caudad and ventrad by the superior
mesenteric vessels, which hence divide this portion of the intestine
into a right and left segment.</p>

<p>The latter turns cephalad and ventrad on the left side of the
vertebral column (4th or ascending portion) to become continuous
at the duodeno-jejunal angle with the free or floating small intestine
(jejunum).</p>

<p>If we imagine in the cat the duodenum anchored or fixed by
adhesion of the dorsal (originally right) leaf of the mesoduodenum
and of its own dorsal visceral peritoneum to the abdominal
parietal peritoneum in the manner above indicated (<a href="#Page_70">p.&nbsp;70</a>) as
far as the duodeno-jejunal angle we will have conditions established
which correspond to those found in the human adult abdominal
cavity.</p>

<p>III. It is next necessary to study carefully the disposition of the
primitive dorsal mesentery connected after rotation with the different
segments of the intestinal tube, ascending, transverse and
descending colon and free small intestine.</p>

<p>In order to obtain in the cat a cephalic limit to the region now
under consideration which will correspond to the arrangement of<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
the adult human peritoneum, we will begin with the peritoneal
membrane attached to the portion of the colon which in the rearranged
intestinal tract represents the human transverse colon.
This transverse segment of the large intestine is now made to extend
directly across the abdomen from the liver to the spleen.
The two layers composing the transverse mesocolon are an upper
or cephalic and a lower or caudal layer.</p>

<p>Now it will be seen in the cat that the upper or cephalic layer
of the transverse mesocolon thus established is continuous on
each side with the dorsal (originally right) leaf of the ascending
and with the dorsal (originally left) leaf of the descending mesocolon,
which peritoneal layers are in direct opposition to the
parietal lumbar and prerenal peritoneum. On the other hand,
the inferior or ventral layer of the transverse mesocolon is continuous
on each side of the median line with the ventral (originally
respectively left and right) leaves of the same mesocola,
while at the site of the duodeno-colic isthmus the two layers of
the transverse mesocolon are continuous as originally with the
two layers of the mesentery of the jejuno-ileum (<a href="#Fig_146">Fig. 146</a>).</p>

<p>Now fix the transverse mesocolon firmly against the background
of the abdomen and place the ascending and descending
colon as far as possible over to the right and left side respectively.
We will assume a line of secondary adhesion between the transverse
mesocolon and the parietal peritoneum investing the dorsal
abdominal wall. Along this line the upper or cephalic surface of
the transverse mesocolon would become continuous with the dorsal
parietal peritoneum, while the lower or caudal layer would still
be continuous with the left leaf of the ascending and the right
leaf of the descending mesocolon. We have already seen that the
duodenum and mesoduodenum become anchored in the subhepatic
region and that the visceral ventral peritoneum of the
gut and the original left leaf of the mesoduodenum appear then
as secondary parietal peritoneum. Hence a sagittal section
through the right lumbar region, right kidney and descending
duodenum would, immediately after rotation and establishment<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
of the transverse mesocolon, show the peritoneal arrangement
indicated in Fig. 153. After adhesion of the transverse mesocolon
continuity would be established between its upper or cephalic
layer and the secondary parietal peritoneum investing the supra-colic
portion of the descending duodenum (Fig. 154) while its
caudal layer becomes continuous with the secondary parietal
peritoneum covering the infra-colic segment of the duodenum and
the lower portion of the ventral surface of the right kidney.</p>

<p>Reference to the schematic Figs. 152, 153 and 154, will
show that the adult duodenum becomes fixed to the posterior
parietes of the abdomen by adhesion of its visceral serous
covering and of the dorsal layer of the mesoduodenum to
the primitive parietal peritoneum. The supra-colic segment of
the adult descending duodenum lies under cover of a single
peritoneal layer, derived from its own visceral investment and
appearing as secondary parietal peritoneum by continuity laterad
along the line of adhesion with the primitive parietal peritoneum
covering the upper part of ventral surface of right kidney, while
mesad, the layer covering this segment of the duodenum, is continued
into the secondary parietal peritoneum derived from the
left or ventral leaf of the mesoduodenum and covering the ventral
surface of the pancreas (cf. <a href="#Fig_138">Figs. 138</a>-<a href="#Fig_140">140</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the infra-colic segment of the descending
duodenum, as well as the lower and mesal angle of the ventral
surface of right kidney, between ascending and transverse colon,
is covered by a layer of secondary parietal peritoneum derived
from the ventral layer of the ascending mesocolon and continuous
with the caudal layer of the transverse mesocolon. Beneath
this secondary parietal peritoneum are two obliterated layers, on
the one hand the dorsal layer of the mesocolon, on the other the
visceral infra-colic duodenal serosa and the primitive prerenal
parietal peritoneum.</p>

<p>In the further development of the adult human arrangement
the changes below the level of the transverse colon and mesocolon
result in the fixation of the ascending and descending colon<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
to the background of the right and left lumbar regions. The
opposed serous surfaces of the ascending and descending mesocola
and of the dorsal parietal peritoneum adhere and the process also
usually involves the dorsal visceral peritoneum of the ascending
and descending colon, so that these portions of the gut obtain a
fixed position.</p>

<p>Adhesion of the mesocolon to the dorsal body wall (parietal
peritoneum) does not occur at all points at the same time. Usually
adhesion proceeds from the midline laterad. The fixation of the
ascending colon in the human embryo begins about the fourth
month.</p>

<p>In the descending segment by the same time adhesion has
usually proceeded nearly up to the descending colon, but the intestine
itself is as yet free. In the fifth month the descending
colon has usually become fixed between the splenic flexure and
the beginning of the sigmoidea. In the latter region a free mesocolon
usually persists throughout life.</p>

<p>Differences in the rate of growth between the length of the
body wall and the length of the mesocolon may play an important
part in the production of peritoneal <i>fossæ</i>, small pouches
which in some regions of the abdomen may assume considerable
proportions. Such fossæ are found around the duodeno-jejuneal
angle, the cæcum and appendix, and the sigmoid flexure. They
will be considered more in detail with these respective regions,
especially in reference to their relation to retro-peritoneal hernia.</p>

<p>In a certain proportion of cases adhesion between the parietal
peritoneum and the ascending and descending mesocolon is incomplete
or entirely wanting, resulting in the formation of a more or
less completely free ascending and descending mesocolon. Treves,
in an examination of 100 bodies, obtained the following figures:</p>

<p>In 52 subjects there was neither an ascending nor a descending
mesocolon, the intestine being fixed in the manner which is regarded
as normal.</p>

<p>In 22 there was a descending, but no trace of an ascending
mesocolon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span></p>

<p>In 14 a mesocolon was found in both the ascending and descending
segments of the large intestine.</p>

<p>In 12 there was an ascending mesocolon, but no corresponding
fold on the left side. Hence from this series a mesocolon may
be expected on the left side in 36 per cent., on the right side in
26 per cent.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/fig155.jpg" width="500" height="599" alt="" />
<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_155"></a>Fig. 155.</span>&mdash;Abdominal viscera of <i>Macacus cynomolgus</i>, Kra monkey, hardened <i>in situ</i>. (Columbia
University Museum, No. 1801.)
</div>

<p>Both development and comparative anatomy would lead us to
expect that the descending mesocolon would be found more frequently
than the ascending.</p>

<p>In the lower animals the descending mesocolon is always an
extensive and conspicuous membrane. It is well developed in all
monkeys and the anthropoidea, as the remains of the primary
vertical fold of the dorsal mesentery, while the ascending mesocolon
is a secondary production, acquired during the development
of the bowel by rotation.</p>

<p>In most of the lower monkeys the ascending mesocolon is also
largely or entirely free. The descending mesocolon can always
in these animals be reflected to the median line (cf. Fig. 155).</p>

<p>The line of attachment in man of the descending mesocolon is
usually along the lateral border of the left kidney and vertical,
while the line of attachment of the ascending mesocolon is usually
less vertical, crossing the caudal end of the right kidney obliquely
from right to left and with an upward direction (Fig. 156).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/fig156.jpg" width="350" height="290" alt="" />
<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_156"></a>Fig. 156.</span>&mdash;Schema of visceral and peritoneal relations of ventral surface
of right kidney.
</div>

<p>In like manner when both the ascending and descending mesocola
are absent as free membranes the left or descending colon is
adherent along the lateral border of the kidney to the abdominal
parietes, while the ascending colon is fixed at the hepatic flexure
a little obliquely across the ventral surface of the caudal end of
the corresponding gland ascending toward the medial margin.</p>

<p>Treves found in the cases of persistent ascending mesocolon in the
adult that the membrane varied in breadth from 1&#8243; to 2&#8243; while the
persistent fold on the left side varied between 2&#8243; and 3&#8243; in breadth.</p>

<p>In the f&oelig;tus, up to 5&#8243;&ndash;6&#8243; in length, the descending mesocolon
is usually an extensive fold. Its attachment is vertical, but nearer
to the median line than in the adult, usually along the medial<span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
border of the left kidney. It is at times found attached along
this line in the adult.</p>

<p>An ascending mesocolon is rare even in the f&oelig;tus. The cæcum
and beginning of the ascending colon are completely invested by
peritoneum, but above the parts so invested the colon is usually
adherent along an oblique line to the ventral and medial aspect
of the right kidney.</p>

<p>In the f&oelig;tus at full term, if the cæcum is still undescended and
in contact with the liver, it is not uncommon to find the cephalic
portion of the descending colon provided with a mesocolon, while
the caudal part of the descending colon is fixed by adhesion to
the ventral surface and lateral border of the left kidney. This
free membrane is then really a part of the transverse mesocolon.
Where the cæcum descends to the iliac fossa the portion of the
f&oelig;tal descending colon so invested is drawn over to the right and
incorporated in the transverse colon.</p>

<p>Treves in two out of 100 bodies found the cæcum in the right
iliac region, but both it and the whole of the ascending colon
were entirely free from any peritoneal connections with the dorsal
parietes of the abdomen.</p>

<p>The gut from the tip of the cæcum to the hepatic flexure was
entirely invested by peritoneum continuous with the mesentery.
The ascending colon was covered in the same manner and by the
same fold as the small intestine. The segment of large intestine
thus free measured 8&#8243; in both instances.</p>

<p>The mesentery lacked the usual attachment to the dorsal abdominal
wall and its root was represented by the interval between
the duodenum and the transverse colon. The membrane had no
other than its original primary attachment, and small intestine
and ascending colon formed together a loop that practically
represented the condition of the great primary intestinal loop.
(Compare <a href="#Page_73">p.&nbsp;73</a>.)</p>

<p>The arrangement presented in these two subjects corresponds to
that met in many animals, such as the cat.</p>

<p>A cross-section of the cat&rsquo;s abdomen arranged as above would<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
show the following disposition of the peritoneum, corresponding
to the stage in the human development preceding the fixation of
the two vertical colic segments (Fig. 157). It will be seen that
the right and left mesocola can be reflected to the median line
where they become continuous ventrad of the vertebral column
and aorta with the mesentery of the small intestine. The ventral
surfaces of both kidneys are seen to be covered by the primitive
parietal peritoneum of the abdominal cavity.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 530px;">

</div>

<p>Fig. 158 shows the adult human arrangement of the same parts,
after fixation of the vertical colic segments by adhesion of the
opposed surfaces of their mesocola and the primitive parietal peritoneum.
The background of the abdomen is now seen to be
covered by a layer of secondary parietal peritoneum, <i>viz.</i>, the
original left leaf of the ascending and right leaf of the descending
mesocolon, continuous above with the lower or caudal layer of the
transverse mesocolon.</p>

<p>This adhesion is so complete that the original condition is disregarded
in adult descriptive anatomy. The layer which has adhered
to the parietal peritoneum can no longer be recognized and
the other has assumed the rôle of parietal peritoneum.</p>

<p>The connection of the transverse mesocolon with the dorsal
lamella of the great omentum will be considered below.</p>

<p>The course of the vessels in the ascending and descending mesocola
is not altered by the secondary adhesions. These vessels are
in the adult situated behind the secondary parietal peritoneum
derived from the mesocola.</p>

<p>The origin of the transverse mesocolon obtains by the fixation
of the hepatic and splenic flexures high up in the abdomen a
transverse course, and the transverse growth of the abdomen
holds the membrane in this position cephalad of the duodeno-jejunal
flexure, so that on elevating the transverse colon the
mesocolon appears as separating the upper from the lower abdominal
compartment. This posterior line of attachment or so-called
&ldquo;root of the transverse mesocolon,&rdquo; is nothing more than
the upper limit of the area of adhesion between the primitive<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
parietal peritoneum and the opposed surfaces of the ascending
and descending mesocola. Reference to the abdominal cavity of
the cat after complete rotation (<a href="#Fig_146">Fig. 146</a>) will show the original
continuity of the three mesocola very clearly. A secondary connection
is established along the lateral border of ascending and
descending colon (Fig. 158), between the primitive parietal peritoneum
and the ventral visceral peritoneal investment of the
large intestine. Both of the vertical segments of the colon now
appear fixed. Their dorsal surfaces are uncovered by peritoneum
and can be reached in the lumbar region, laterad of the kidney,
without opening the peritoneal cavity (lumbar colotomy).</p>

<p>The caudal portions of both kidneys are covered, beneath the
secondary parietal peritoneum, by a layer of loose connective tissue
representing the result of obliteration by adhesion of the first
and second of the original three layers of prerenal peritoneum,
<i>viz.</i>, the primitive parietal (1) and the two layers of the mesocola
(2 and 3).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Line of Attachment of the Mesentery of the Jejuno-ileum.</span>&mdash;Examination
of the caudal surface of the transverse mesocolon
in the cat, with the parts in the above outlined position, will show
how and why in the adult human abdomen the duodeno-jejunal
angle appears to dip out from beneath the transverse mesocolon,
becoming gradually more and more free until complete transition
to the mobile jejunum is obtained. From this point, situated to
the left of the second lumbar vertebra, the dorsal attachment
of the adult human mesentery of the jejuno-ileum extends somewhat
obliquely caudad and to the right to terminate in the right
iliac fossa at the ileo-colic junction.</p>

<p>Returning to the conditions presented by the cat&rsquo;s intestines
to obtain an explanation of this line of fixation we must recall
the fact that in the peritoneum included within the limits of the
umbilical loop, after differentiation of small and large intestine,
but before rotation, we have both the elements of the mesentery
of the small intestines and of the ascending and transverse mesocolon
combined (<a href="#Fig_141">Fig. 141</a>). For it will be seen that this mem<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>brane
carries at this time vessels both to the jejuno-ileum and to
the segments of the large intestine (cæcum, ascending and transverse
colon). This fact will be at once recognized if the cat&rsquo;s intestines
are arranged to correspond to the primitive condition
(<a href="#Fig_136">Fig. 136</a>) and the mesentery examined.</p>

<p>After rotation and differentiation of the colic segments and after
the adhesion of the ascending and descending colon in man, the
course of the main trunk of the superior mesenteric artery passes,
after crossing the third portion of the duodenum, down and to the
right to terminate near the ileo-colic junction by anastomosis with
its ileo-colic branch. The adhesion of the right and left mesocola
to the dorsal parietal peritoneum proceeds mesad as far as
this line, leaving free the mesentery of the small intestines, which
contains the vasa intestini tenuis derived from the left side of the
main vessel. The secondary line of attachment of the mesentery
to the abdominal background is therefore along this line. To
obtain a clear idea of these processes of development in man assume
that in the cat, after rotation and establishment of the three
divisions of the colon, the two vertical (ascending and descending)
mesocola become adherent to the dorsal parietal peritoneum, leaving
the mesentery of the small intestine free.</p>

<p>Fixation of the ascending and descending cola and of their
mesocola proceeds cephalad as far as the line <i>AB</i>, which thereby
constitutes the root of the free transverse mesocolon.</p>

<p>The secondary parietal peritoneum derived from the ventral
layer of the ascending mesocolon covers the lower and inner portion
of the ventral surface of the right kidney, the infra-colic
division of the descending and the dextro-mesenteric segment of
the transverse duodenum, while along the root of the jejuno-ileal
mesentery it becomes continuous with the right layer of that membrane.
The secondary parietal peritoneum derived from the ventral
layer of the descending colon covers the lower part of the ven<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>tral
surface of the left kidney and the sinistro-mesenteric segment
of the transverse duodenum and becomes continuous along the
mesenteric radix with the left layer of the jejuno-ileal mesentery.</p>

<p>Caudad the adhesion of the descending colon and mesocolon to
the parietal peritoneum proceeds only to the point <i>C</i>, following
the dotted line mesad and resulting in the formation of the free
mesocolon of the sigmoid flexure.</p>

<p><b>Résumé of the Adult Arrangement of the Human Peritoneum in the
Lower Compartment of the Abdomen, Below the Level of the Transverse
Colon and Mesocolon.</b>&mdash;We should now consider the arrangement
of the human peritoneum in the adult below the dorsal
attachment of the transverse mesocolon in the light of the embryological
and comparative anatomical facts just stated. In
doing this it will be advisable to study both the actual conditions
encountered and their significance in the sense of determining
the derivation of the peritoneal layers from the primitive dorsal
mesentery. Open the abdominal cavity in the usual manner by
a cruciform incision.</p>

<p>Turn the great omentum up on the chest wall, exposing the
underlying intestines. This manipulation, as already stated, will
cause the omentum to carry the transverse colon with it, on
account of the adhesion, in the adult, of the gut to the dorsal
layer of the omentum. Hence the cephalic or upper layer of the
transverse mesocolon will not be seen at this stage because the
omental adhesion just referred to prevents us from passing between
the greater curvature of the stomach and the transverse
colon without tearing peritoneal layers. It will, however, be possible
to trace on the right side the duodenum from the pylorus
down ventrad of the right kidney until the descending portion
disappears behind the hepatic flexure of the colon. With the
omentum and transverse mesocolon turned up, as stated, and the
transverse mesocolon put upon the stretch, it will be seen that the
abdominal space now overlooked is bounded cephalad by the
lower layer of the transverse mesocolon and its attachment to the
dorsal abdominal wall. The lateral limits of the space are given<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
by the ascending and descending colon respectively. The attachment
of the mesentery of the small intestine to the oblique line
extending from the left of the vertebral column at about the
level of the second lumbar vertebra to the right iliac fossa subdivides
the entire space into a secondary right and left compartment.</p>

<p>Begin by following the caudal layer of the transverse mesocolon
dorsad on the right side. In the angle between ascending
and transverse colon (hepatic flexure) pressure will locate the
caudal portion of the ventral surface of the right kidney. Remember
that the peritoneum touched in these procedures appears
in the adult as parietal prerenal peritoneum, but that in reality
it is the left leaf of the originally free ascending mesocolon, whereas
the original right leaf of this membrane and the primitive parietal
peritoneum have, by adhesion of their serous surfaces, been converted
into the loose subserous connective tissue covering the
ventral aspect of the kidney beneath what now appears as
parietal peritoneum.</p>

<p>Mesad of the resistance offered to the finger by the right kidney
the caudal (infra-colic) portion of the descending duodenum and
the angle of transition between it and the third or transverse
portion will be found, invested in the same way by secondary
(mesocolic) parietal peritoneum. It will be seen, especially if the
duodenum is injected or inflated, that the hepatic flexure of the
colon lies ventrad of the vertical descending second portion of the
duodenum, so that one part of this intestine is situated cephalad
the other caudad of the colon. (Supra- and infra-colic segments
of descending duodenum.)</p>

<p>Individual differences are observed in the area of colic attachment
to the duodenum. Usually the two intestines are in contact
with each other and adherent over a considerable surface.
Exceptionally the transverse mesocolon extends across to the
right so as to include the hepatic flexure. In this latter case the
uncovered non-peritoneal surface of the descending duodenum is
small, represented by the interval between the layers of the trans<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>verse
mesocolon, and the hepatic flexure is then not directly adherent
to the gut.</p>

<p>If we now trace the transverse duodenum from right to left we
will encounter the right layer of the root of the jejuno-ileal mesentery.
The caudal layer of the transverse mesocolon, the right
leaf of the mesentery and the secondary parietal peritoneum investing
the ventral surface of the transverse duodenum all meet at
this point. Surround the mesentery of the free small intestine
with the fingers of one hand so that the entire mass of intestinal
coils can be swung alternately from side to side.</p>

<p>Turning them over to the left, as already stated, the proximal
portion of the transverse duodenum can be traced from right to
left as far as the root of the mesentery. Here the peritoneum
investing the ventral surface of the duodenum becomes continuous
with the right leaf of the mesentery. Now swing the
whole mass of small intestines over to the right, exposing the
parietal peritoneum in the space to the left of the vertebral
column, between the attachment of the mesentery to the median
side, the root of transverse mesocolon cephalad and the descending
colon to the left. Remember that the same significance attaches
to this secondary parietal peritoneum as on the right side.
It appears in the adult as parietal peritoneum, but is in its derivation
the original right leaf of the descending mesocolon. Close
to the root of the mesentery the continuation from the right side
of the transverse duodenum will be seen, crossing the median line
from right to left ventrad of aorta and vertebral column and usually
turning cephalad on the left side of the lumbar vertebræ, as
the fourth or ascending duodenum, to reach the caudal surface of
the transverse mesocolon near its attachment, where the gut turns
ventrad to form the duodeno-jejunal angle and become continuous
with the free small intestine.</p>

<p>From the fact that the transverse duodenum is thus seen on
each side of the root of the mesentery it will be recalled that
after rotation of the primitive intestine the superior mesenteric
artery crosses the transverse portion of the duodenum to reach its<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
distribution between the leaves of the mesentery. Hence this
portion of the small intestine consists of a dextro- and sinistro-mesenteric
segment. This intersection of mesentery and duodenum
marks the site of the primitive duodeno-colic isthmus
through which the superior mesenteric artery passed to reach its
distribution to the gut composing the embryonic umbilical loop.</p>

<p>To the left of the ascending duodenum a portion of the caudal
surface of the pancreas will be seen, covered by the continuation
of the caudal leaf of the transverse mesocolon into the parietal
peritoneum. The consideration of this relation of peritoneum
and pancreas will profitably be deferred until we have studied
the developmental changes in the region of the dorsal mesogastrium
and great omentum.</p>

<p>In the angle between termination of the transverse colon and
proximal part of descending colon (splenic flexure) the caudal
part of the ventral surface of the left kidney will be felt. The
disposition of the peritoneum and its significance is the same as on
the right side. Inasmuch as we have already seen that the secondary
parietal peritoneum covering the dorsal abdominal wall
on each side of the small intestine&rsquo;s mesenteric attachment is derived
from the primitive ascending and descending mesocolon, it
will be readily understood why the blood vessels supplying the
ascending and descending colon (arteria ileo-colica, a. colica dextra,
a. colica sinistra) are placed <i>behind</i> the parietal peritoneum, while
the colica media, supplying the transverse colon, runs between the
layers of the transverse mesocolon. Originally the same condition
obtained for the two vertical colic segments, but with the anchoring
of these portions of the large intestine and the adhesion of their
mesocola to the parietal peritoneum the blood vessels which formerly
ran between the two layers of the membrane, as long as it remained
free, now appear as retroperitoneal vessels placed beneath
the parietal peritoneum derived secondarily from the mesocola.</p>

<p>This fact must be borne in mind in studying the arrangement
of certain folds and fossæ of the parietal peritoneum which are
now to be considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span></p>

<p><b>Duodenal Fossæ. Fossa of Treitz and Retro-peritoneal Hernia.</b>&mdash;The
peritoneal cavity of the cat can be used to great advantage in
order to obtain a clear idea of the formation of these folds and
fossæ, whose relation to the so-called &ldquo;retro-peritoneal hernia&rdquo;
has led to an exaggerated elaboration of minute detail and a
somewhat puzzling terminology in human descriptive anatomy.</p>

<p><b>Directions for Examining the Folds and the Formation of the Duodeno-jejunal
Fossa in the Cat.</b>&mdash;Turn the omentum and the coils of
the small intestine cephalad out of the abdomen until they rest
upon the ventral thoracic wall. Press the large intestine over to
the left side, putting the mesocolon on the stretch until the parts
are arranged as shown in Fig. 160. The loop of the duodenum
with the head portion of the pancreas will be seen caudad of the
liver and ventrad of the right kidney. A well-marked peritoneal
fold, somewhat sickle-shaped, with the concavity of the free edge
directed caudad and to the right, will be seen extending from the
convex border of the duodenum, directly opposite the mesenteric
or attached margin, to the right leaf of the mesocolon. This
fold indicates the beginning adhesion of the duodenum to the
mesocolic peritoneum, the first step toward the subsequent complete
fixation of the gut as it is found in man.</p>

<p>Fig. 161 shows the abdominal cavity of Nasua rufa, the brown
Coati-mundi, a South American arctoid carnivore, with the intestines
everted and turned to the left side. In this animal the
large intestine is very short, there is no cæcum, the ileo-colic
junction is only marked on the surface by a pyloric-like constriction
of the tube and in the interior by the projection of a ring-valve
(<a href="#Fig_408">Fig. 408</a>).</p>

<p>The duodenal fold is very well developed, passing between the
convex surface of the duodenal loop and the adjacent right leaf of
the short mesocolon.</p>

<p>In Primates, in which complete rotation of the intestine, on
the plan of the human development, takes place, still further and
more extensive agglutination of the serous surface of the duodenum
to the peritoneum of the mesocolon occurs. Fig. 162 shows<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
the condition in <i>Hapale vulgaris</i>, one of the marmosets. The ascending
and descending mesocola and the mesoduodenum of this
animal are still free, but the surface of the duodenum has become
fastened to the opposed mesocolon. With fixation of the hepatic
flexure and adhesion of the ascending colon, such as occurs in
man, the duodenum is carried dorsad against the ventral surface
of the right kidney, and now anchoring of the duodenum, by obliteration
of the mesoduodenum and adhesion to the prerenal
parietal peritoneum, takes place as already detailed above. To
return now to the formation of the duodeno-jejunal fossa by
means of this fold, as illustrated in the cat. Perform the manipulations
already described in rotation of the intestine. The appearance
of the parts then will be as shown in <a href="#Fig_163">Fig. 163</a>. The large
intestine is drawn over so as to represent the human ascending
and transverse colon in one segment, the descending colon in the
other, and the mesocolon appears correspondingly as transverse
and descending. In other words the cat&rsquo;s intestines as arranged
in the figure would represent the stage in the human development
in which cæcum and beginning of large intestine are still
subhepatic in position ventrad of the right kidney, before differentiation
of ascending and transverse colon by descent of cæcum
into right iliac fossa.</p>

<p>In the human subject, as we have seen, the transverse mesocolon
obtains a secondary attachment to the background of the
abdominal cavity, its caudal surface remaining free.</p>

<p>The descending mesocolon turns its original right leaf ventrad,
its left leaf dorsad, and the latter adheres to the primitive parietal
peritoneum covering the left lumbar region and ventral surface of
left kidney. This area of adhesion extends up to and usually
involves the dorsal surface of the descending colon, anchoring
the same in the left lumbar region, down to the point where the
sigmoid flexure begins and where the original mesocolon again
appears free.</p>

<p>In the cat, therefore, with the intestines arranged to correspond
to the course of the human large intestine after rotation has been<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
accomplished, the lines representing the peritoneal human adhesions
should be fixed, as shown in the schema, <a href="#Fig_159">Fig. 159</a>: <span class="lowercase smcap">AB</span>, line
of secondary attachment after rotation resulting in the formation
of the &ldquo;root&rdquo; of a free transverse mesocolon. <span class="lowercase smcap">BC</span>, line of limit of
secondary adhesion to the original parietal peritoneum involving
the entire left (now dorsal) layer of the descending mesocolon and
the dorsal surface of the descending colon, resulting in the fixation
of the latter part of the large intestine.</p>

<p>This establishes, as already stated, a secondary parietal peritoneal
surface in the left lumbar region derived from the original
right leaf of the descending mesocolon. Inasmuch as the inferior
mesenteric vessels originally passed to the descending colon
between the layers of the mesocolon they will now apparently be
placed beneath the (secondary) parietal peritoneum of the left
lumbar region.</p>

<p>If now the duodenal fold in the cat be examined after rotation
of the intestine it will be found presenting the original relations
(<a href="#Fig_160">Figs. 160</a> and 163), viz., passing from the convex margin of that
portion of the duodenal loop which would correspond to the human
fourth or ascending portion, to the original right layer of the mesocolon,
which in man becomes secondarily converted into the
parietal peritoneum of the left lumbar region. Hence the connections
of the fold are as follows:</p>

<p><i>On the right</i>: ventral surface of the ascending duodenum.</p>

<p><i>On the left</i>: right layer of mesocolon (secondary lumbar parietal
peritoneum in the adult human subject).</p>

<p><i>Cephalad</i> it abuts against the caudal layer of the transverse mesocolon
along the line which would correspond to the root of the
mesocolon in the adult human subject.</p>

<p>The concave <i>caudal</i> edge is free and bounds the entrance into a
fossa, the &ldquo;superior duodenal fossa&rdquo; of anthropotomy. This fossa
opens caudad and extends cephalad to the root of the transverse
mesocolon. The ventral and left wall of the fossa is formed by
the fold in question, its background by the mesocolon (right
leaf); to the right the left circumference of the ascending duo<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>denum
enters into the formation of the fossa, and its fundus is
formed by the confluence of the fold and of the caudal layer of
the transverse mesocolon. The inferior mesenteric vessels are
found near the left margin of the entrance into the fossa.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 164 shows the appearance of the fold in <i>Nasua rufa</i> after
rotation of the intestine. The short course of the large intestine in
this animal, and the consequent reduction of the mesocolon, brings
the fold much below the level which it occupies in the cat.</p>

<p>If we now look for the corresponding structures in man we will
find certain modifications depending chiefly upon still closer adhesion
between duodenum and the mesocolon which is destined
to become the left parietal peritoneum after anchoring of the
descending colon. We have already encountered an example of
such closer connection in the marmoset shown in <a href="#Fig_162">Fig. 162</a>.</p>

<p>In all cases the &ldquo;superior duodenal&rdquo; fold, corresponding to the
fold just encountered in the cat, is the original condition, and the
duodenal fossa consequently opens caudad. In many instances
this will be the only fold and fossa encountered in the adult
human subject. In other instances more extensive duodeno-mesocolic
adhesions result in the addition of an &ldquo;inferior fold,&rdquo;
bounding a fossa the entrance into which is directed cephalad toward
the transverse mesocolon. Such a condition is seen in Fig.
165 taken from a f&oelig;tus at term. The duodenal fossa in this case
is bounded by an &ldquo;upper&rdquo; and &ldquo;lower&rdquo; duodenal fold continuous
with each other on the left side, but separated on the right at their
attachment to the duodenum. It will be seen that the inferior
mesenteric vein runs in the left margin of the fold, following
along the left border of the entrance into the fossa. A segment
of the colica sinistra artery may occupy the same position. This
position of the vein, or artery, or of both vessels, is not the cause
leading to the formation of the duodenal fossa, but is more or less
accidental and variable. In many cases the vessels run at some
distance from the folds bounding the fossa.</p>

<p>In some subjects the &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; fold is the only one found,
and the only duodenal fossa then encountered looks cephalad.<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
This condition, when associated with the course of the inferior
mesenteric vessels in the free edge of the fold, constituted the
classical &ldquo;fossa duodeno-jejunalis&rdquo; of Treitz, and is described as
&ldquo;Treitz&rsquo;s fossa.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 166 shows the condition in which only a small inferior fold
attaches itself to the termination of the transverse duodenum.
There is practically an entire absence of duodenal or duodeno-jejunal
folds and fossæ. The inferior mesenteric vessels course
under cover of the mesocolic secondary parietal peritoneum, but
do not produce a fold.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_167">Fig. 167</a>, from an adult human subject, illustrates the further
development of the fossa from the f&oelig;tal conditions shown in Fig.
165. The well-marked duodenal fossa is bounded by a superior
and inferior duodenal fold, uniting laterally in a crescentic margin
containing a segment of the inferior mesenteric vein and
colica sinistra artery. The lower division of the peritoneal recess
thus produced corresponds to the typical (vascular) &ldquo;fossa of
Treitz.&rdquo; Mesally the projection of the fourth portion of the duodenum
bounds the fossa.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_168">Fig. 168</a>, also taken from an adult human subject, an extensive
duodenal recess is bounded in the same way by a superior
and inferior duodenal fold. In the interior of the fossa a third
duodenal reduplication of the peritoneum (&ldquo;intermediate duodenal
fold&rdquo;) is seen, as is also the trunk of the inferior mesenteric vein,
while the main trunk of the colica sinistra artery courses laterally
behind the secondary mesocolic parietal peritoneum near the
margin of the descending colon.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the freedom of the ascending or fourth portion
of the duodenum depends largely upon the disposition and
extent of these folds. Inasmuch as they are the product of varying
degrees of adhesion of this segment of the intestine they are
subject to great individual variations and have given rise to an
unnecessary and complicated classification of the duodenal folds
and fossæ. The close relation maintained between the duodeno-jejunal
angle and the caudal layer of the transverse mesocolon<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
near its root at times leads to the production of a peritoneal fold
connecting this membrane with the duodeno-jejunal knuckle of
intestine (duodeno-jejunal or mesocolic fold) and may result in
the formation of a duodeno-jejunal or mesocolic fossa of the peritoneum.
An instance of this fold is seen in <a href="#Fig_168">Fig. 168</a>.</p>

<p>The importance of the duodenal fossæ, and of similar peritoneal
recesses in other parts of the abdominal cavity, is founded on the
fact that by gradual enlargement they may lodge the greater part
of the movable small intestine in their interior, leading to the
formation of intra- or retro-peritoneal herniæ.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p><b>Fossa Intersigmoidea.</b>&mdash;A second peritoneal pocket or fossa is
encountered in the region of the sigmoid flexure and its mesocolon.
The formation of this fossa is closely associated with the
adult disposition of the sigmoid mesocolon as part of the original
primitive vertical dorsal mesentery. In the typical arrangement
of the parts the sigmoid or omega loop of the large intestine has
a free mesocolon. The adhesion of the descending mesocolon to
the parietal peritoneum usually ceases along a line drawn horizontally
from the lateral margin of the left psoas at a level with
the crest of the ilium to the medial side of the iliac vessels. This
line, along which the mesocolon ceases to be adherent to the parietal
peritoneum, joins the attachment of the distal portion of
the sigmoid mesocolon, which partially retains its primitive vertical
origin to the dorsal midline, at a right angle. This angle
is the site of the <i>intersigmoid fossa</i>, the entrance into which is
seen usually as a round opening of variable size on elevating the
sigmoid flexure and putting its mesocolon on the stretch. <a href="#Fig_159">Fig.
159</a> shows the area of adhesion between the primitive descending
mesocolon and the parietal peritoneum (from <span class="lowercase smcap">C</span> mesad) which results
in the formation of a free mesocolon for the sigmoid flexure.
Frequently in the angle formed by the horizontal and vertical
line of attachment of the sigmoid mesocolon a non-adherent
strip of the primitive mesocolon roofs in a more or less extensive
<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>intersigmoid fossa, whose fundus is directed upwards and inwards.</p>

<p><b>Cæcum, Appendix and Ileo-colic Junction.</b>&mdash;Several peritoneal
fossæ and folds are found in the ileo-colic region in connection
with the cæcum, appendix and termination of the ileum. The
practical importance of this portion of the intestinal tract and
the great morphological interest which attaches to the same make
it worth while to consider its anatomy in a separate chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span></p>
<h2>PART II.</h2>

<h2>ANATOMY OF THE PERITONEUM IN THE
SUPRA-COLIC COMPARTMENT OF
THE ABDOMEN.</h2>


<p>We have already seen that the transverse colon and mesocolon
effect a general division of the adult human abdominal
cavity into a cephalic supra-colic compartment, situated between
the diaphragm and the level of the transverse colon and mesocolon,
comprising in general the hypochondriac and epigastric
regions, and a larger caudal infra-colic space which includes the
entire rest of the abdominal cavity and is continued caudad into the
pelvic cavity. The arrangement of the peritoneum and viscera
in this latter space has just been considered. The fact will be
recalled that the second or descending portion of the duodenum,
passing dorsad of the hepatic colic flexure, forms so to speak the
visceral connection between the portions of the alimentary tube
situated in the supra-colic compartment and those situated in the
infra-colic space. The fixation of this segment of the duodenum
and its consequent secondary retroperitoneal position in the adult
human subject masks this continuity of the alimentary canal to
a certain extent so that it requires more than a superficial examination
in order to trace correctly the course of the duodenum
from the pylorus to the duodeno-jejunal angle, dorsad of the
colon, root of transverse mesocolon and mesentery, and under
cover of the secondary parietal peritoneum.</p>

<p>We have now to turn our attention to the viscera contained in
the cephalic or supra-colic compartment of the abdomen and to
consider the disposition of the serous membrane investing them
and connecting them with each other and with the abdominal
parietes.</p>

<p>The visceral contents of the supra-colic compartment comprise<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
the liver, pancreas, spleen, stomach and the proximal portion of
the duodenum, including the hepatic angle and the supra-colic
part of the descending duodenum. Less directly the cephalic
portions of the right and left kidney and the corresponding suprarenal
capsules belong to this visceral group.</p>

<p>In this region of the abdomen we meet with the most extensive
modifications of the primitive dorsal peritoneal membrane,
producing conditions which, considered without reference to development
and comparative anatomy, are complex and difficult of
comprehension. These changes lead to the formation of the so-called
&ldquo;lesser sac,&rdquo; a term which in some respects is unfortunate
as it implies a more complete degree of separation from the general
peritoneal cavity or &ldquo;greater sac&rdquo; than actually exists.</p>

<p>In order to clearly understand the adult arrangement of the
peritoneum in this region it is advisable to consider the subject
in two distinct subdivisions, dealing successively with the two
cardinal facts which contribute to effect the change from the simple
primitive to the complicated adult condition.</p>

<p>These two main elements are:</p>

<p>1. Developmental changes in the position of the stomach, alterations
in the disposition of the proximal part of the primitive
dorsal mesentery attached to the stomach, and the development
of pancreas and spleen in connection with this membrane.</p>

<p>2. The development of the liver and the successive stages in
the production of the final adult vascular and serous relations of
this organ.</p>

<p><b>1. Stomach and Dorsal Mesogastrium.</b>&mdash;We have already considered
the early stages in the differentiation of the stomach from
the primitive intestinal tube of uniform caliber (<a href="#Page_40">p.&nbsp;40</a>). It will
be recalled that the stomach at a certain period, while it already
presents the main structural features familiar in the adult organ,
occupies a vertical position in the abdominal cavity, turning its
concave margin (lesser curvature) ventrad, while the convex dorsal
border (greater curvature) is directed toward the vertebral
column, being attached to the same by the layers of the proximal<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
part of the primitive dorsal mesentery. At this time the stomach
presents right and left surfaces, and the &oelig;sophageal entrance is
at the highest or cephalic point of the organ, while the pyloric
transition to the small intestine occupies the distal caudal extremity.</p>

<p>The primitive dorsal mesentery, as already stated, passes as a
thin double-layered membrane between the ventral surface of the
vertebral column and the dorsal border of the stomach, which, as
we will presently see, becomes during the later stages of development
the caudal (lower) margin or greater curvature.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the embryonic differentiation of the intestinal
tract into successive segments justifies the application of a
terminology based on this differentiation to the corresponding
portions of the primitive common dorsal mesentery.</p>

<p>Thus the proximal portion extending between the vertebral
column and the dorsal border or greater curvature of the stomach
becomes the <i>mesogastrium</i>; we differentiate this portion
still further as the &ldquo;<i>dorsal mesogastrium</i>&rdquo; to distinguish it
from a &ldquo;<i>ventral mesogastrium</i>&rdquo; which we will presently encounter
in considering the development of the liver and the connected
peritoneum.</p>

<p>In the same way the section of the primitive common dorsal
mesentery attached to the duodenal loop becomes the <i>mesoduodenum</i>,
that connected with the mobile part of the small intestine
(jejuno-ileum) the <i>mesentery</i> proper, while the portion passing to
the colon forms the <i>mesocolon</i>, to be subsequently still further
subdivided, after the different segments of the large intestine have
become mapped out, as the <i>ascending</i>, <i>transverse</i> and <i>descending
mesocolon</i>, the <i>mesosigmoidea</i> and the <i>mesorectum</i>.</p>

<p>In tracing the development of the adult human peritoneum it
is well to consider certain stages, which we will find illustrated by
the permanent conditions presented by some of the lower vertebrates:</p>

<p>These stages comprise:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Changes in the position of the stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Changes in the direction and extent of the dorsal mesogastrium.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Development of the pancreas and spleen in connection with
the mesogastrium.</p>


<p class="center"><b>A. Changes in the Position of the Stomach.</b></p>

<p>The primitive position of the organ above outlined (<a href="#Page_41">p.&nbsp;41</a>) is
changed during the course of further development by a twofold
rotation.</p>

<p>1. The primitive vertical position, in which the &oelig;sophageal entrance
occupies the highest cephalic extremity, while the pyloric
opening is at the opposite caudal end, is exchanged for one directed
more transversely, approximating the two gastric orifices to the
same horizontal level. In human embryos of 13.9&nbsp;mm. the fundus
has already descended, the pylorus moving cephalad and to the
right, while the cardia becomes shifted more to the left. At the
same time the greater growth and prominence of the convex border
or greater curvature becomes marked in comparison with the relatively
short extent of the opposite margin or lesser curvature.</p>

<p>2. Coincident with this change in position is a rotation around
the vertical axis, by means of which the original left side of the
stomach is turned ventrad, becoming the ventral or &ldquo;anterior&rdquo;
surface, while the original right surface of the organ now looks
dorsad toward the vertebral column, becoming the dorsal or
&ldquo;posterior&rdquo; surface of human anatomy. The &oelig;sophageal or
cephalic end is placed to the left of the median line, while the
caudal or pyloric end is situated on the right side (Figs. 169
and 170).</p>

<p>The original ventral border, now the &ldquo;lesser curvature&rdquo; or
&ldquo;upper border,&rdquo; looks cephalad and to the right, toward the
caudal surface of the liver, while the original dorsal border, as the
&ldquo;greater curvature&rdquo; or &ldquo;lower border&rdquo; is directed in the main
caudad and to the left.</p>

<p>The prominence of this border is still further increased by the
greater development of the stomach to the left of the &oelig;sophageal<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
entrance resulting in the formation of the &ldquo;fundus&rdquo; or &ldquo;great
cul-de-sac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This rotation of the stomach explains the asymmetrical position
of the vagus nerve in the adult, the left side of the embryonic
stomach, innervated by the left vagus, becoming the &ldquo;anterior&rdquo;
surface of adult descriptive anatomy and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>It will be readily appreciated that a comparatively flat organ
like the stomach, will, as long as it occupies a sagittal position,
with right and left surfaces, help to divide the upper part of the
abdominal cavity to a certain extent into a right and left half, even
if the peritoneal connections of the organ are left out of consideration.
As soon, however, as the above-described changes in position
take place and the surfaces of the stomach are directed ventrad
and dorsad, the relative arrangement and extent of this
right and left abdominal space becomes altered by the different
disposition of the septum, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the stomach. The original right
side of the organ is now directed dorsad, and the rotation of the
organ has created a space between this dorsal or &ldquo;posterior&rdquo;
surface of the stomach and the background of the abdominal
cavity, which is the inception of the &ldquo;lesser peritoneal cavity&rdquo;
or retrogastric space. We will find that this space becomes well
defined and circumscribed by the peritoneal connections of the
stomach, but we will realize, even at this stage, that the <i>dorsal</i>
surface of the stomach will form a part of the general <i>ventral</i>
wall of the lesser peritoneal space.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the partial division of the abdomen into a
right and left half, effected by the stomach in its primitive sagittal
position, disappears after rotation of the organ. We now pass
uninterruptedly from left to right across the ventral (original <i>left</i>)
surface of the stomach.</p>

<p class="center"><b>B. Changes in the Direction and Extent of the Dorsal Mesogastrium.</b></p>

<p>The effects of the altered position of the stomach on the disposition
of the abdominal space have just been considered in relation
to the organ itself, without reference to its natural connec<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>tions
with the parietes and with adjacent viscera. Their true significance
and their influence on the adult anatomical arrangement
of the abdomen is, however, only appreciated when the
changes in the arrangement of the peritoneal membrane which
they involve, are taken into account.</p>

<p>The dorsal mesogastrium changes more than any other portion
of the peritoneum in the course of development. It not only
becomes displaced and altered in direction by the rotation of the
stomach, but in addition it grows so extensively that it finally
hangs down like an apron over the entire mass of small intestines,
forming the great omentum.</p>

<p>If we begin with the primitive disposition of the sagittal stomach
and dorsal mesogastrium shown in Fig. 171 it will be observed that
both structures together actually divide the dorsal portion of the
abdominal cavity into symmetrical right and left halves (Fig. 172).</p>

<p>After rotation of the stomach (Fig. 173) the mesogastrium loses
its original sagittal direction. It follows the altered position of
the original dorsal border of the stomach, which has now become
the caudal margin or &ldquo;greater curvature,&rdquo; by turning caudad and
to the left, being at the same time considerably elongated. This
occurs during the second month. Hence the dorsal mesogastrium,
after leaving the vertebral column, turns ventrad and to the left
to reach its gastric attachment along the greater curvature. This
is the first indication of the formation of the great omental or
epiploic bursa.</p>

<p>The stomach is here considered as developing in situ and as influencing
by its growth and change of position the arrangement
and direction of the peritoneal layers with which it is connected.
As a matter of fact it is well to note that the stomach at first lies
above the primitive diaphragm or septum transversum, migrating,
however, at an early period into the subhepatic abdominal position.
This migration produces a corresponding increase in the
length of the &oelig;sophagus (<a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>) and the stomach, in consequence
of this change in position, acquires its ventral and dorsal
mesogastrium. For the purpose of explaining the adult peri<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>toneal relations of the organ it is, however, more convenient to
regard the stomach as an abdominal organ from the beginning
and to deal with the subsequent changes in position from this
standpoint. The inaccuracy is slight and renders the comprehension
of the succeeding stages easier.</p>

<p>It will be noticed (Fig. 173) that the rudimentary retro-gastric
space or &ldquo;lesser peritoneal sac&rdquo; is bounded ventrally by the dorsal
(the primitive <i>right</i>) surface of the stomach, while its dorsal
boundary is furnished by the ventral (originally <i>right</i>) layer of
the dorsal mesogastrium.</p>

<p>In the primitive condition, therefore, dorsal mesogastrium and
stomach form together a straight line sagittal in direction and
placed in the median plane of the body. As the result of the
developmental changes above outlined this straight line becomes
bent at the point where the mesogastrium reaches the stomach
(Fig. 173, x). The two component elements of the line (stomach
and mesogastrium) hinge on each other here, and the angle which
they form opens to the right.</p>

<p>The changes which are to be observed in the later stages depend
principally upon a peculiar feature characteristic of the development
of the dorsal mesogastrium. This feature consists in the
extreme redundancy of the membrane which grows out of proportion
to the requirements of its visceral connections, and to a
certain extent becomes independent of the direct mechanical purpose
of carrying blood vessels to the viscera. Hence in a transverse
section at this period (Figs. 174 and 175) the mesogastrium
no longer passes in a direct line between its points of attachment,
viz. the greater curvature of the stomach and the vertebral column,
but extends beyond the stomach to the left. We will
appreciate the significance of this extensive growth of the mesogastrium
especially in considering the development of the spleen
and pancreas. For the present it will suffice to note (Figs. 174
and 175) that the growth has carried the mesogastrium well to
the left of the stomach, consequently the retrogastric space is now
bounded toward the left by the bend which the original right leaf<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
of the primitive sagittal mesogastrium takes in order to reach its
gastric attachment. The retrogastric space therefore terminates
toward the left in a blind pocket formed by this reduplication of
the mesogastrium.</p>

<p>One more factor is to be taken into consideration, namely the
tendency, already noted, of peritoneal surfaces to become adherent
to each other. Such adhesion involves the apposed surfaces of
the mesogastrium and of the primitive parietal peritoneum to
the left of the vertebral column. The dorsal (original <i>left</i>) layer
of the mesogastrium adheres to the parietal peritoneum covering
the left side of the abdominal background and the cephalic portion
of the ventral surface of the left kidney up to the end of
the blind pouch which forms the extreme left limit of the retrogastric
space. Hence, after this process of adhesion is completed,
the dorsal wall of the retrogastric space is lined by secondary
parietal peritoneum covering the left kidney (original right leaf
of primitive mesogastrium) (Fig. 175). We obtain (Fig. 175 at
x) an apparent continuity of the parietal peritoneum with that
portion of the mesogastrium which, derived from the original
left layer of the membrane, appears now to extend, as the ventral
one of two layers, between the stomach and the abdominal
parietes near the lateral border of the left kidney. (Primitive
gastro-splenic omentum.)</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the disposition of the peritoneum
just indicated is modified by the development of the pancreas
and spleen, both of which organs are intimately associated with
the mesogastrium. The foregoing statements and diagrams are
therefore merely given for the purpose of affording a general view
of the extent, growth and changes of the dorsal mesogastrium
before proceeding to consider the development of the pancreas
and spleen in and from the membrane itself.</p>

<p>In the view directly from in front the redundancy of the peritoneum
forming the mesogastrium is shown in Figs. 176 and 177.
Just as the membrane extends further to the left than required by
its visceral connection with the stomach, so the downward growth<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
exceeds the demand made by the rotation of the attached border
(greater curvature) caudad and to the left. The mesogastrium,
forming, as it now does, the great omentum, enlarges in descending
toward the transverse colon (Fig. 177). The bag thus formed
can be distended with air in a f&oelig;tus of from 8 to 9&nbsp;cm. vertex-coccygeal
measure, as shown in the figure. Consequently in sagittal
section the membrane is seen to extend caudad beyond the
level of the greater curvature, and must turn on itself and pass
again cephalad in order to reach the stomach (<a href="#Fig_178">Fig. 178</a>). By
reason of this excessive growth the limits of the primitive retrogastric
space are enlarged, not only toward the left, but more
especially in the caudal direction. The bend made by the mesogastrium
in returning to the stomach forms the blind extremity
of a pouch which continues the retrogastric space caudad beyond
the stomach, and whose dorsal and ventral walls are formed by
the reduplicated mesogastrium. This pocket or pouch constitutes
the <i>omental</i> or <i>epiploic bursa</i> of the lesser peritoneal cavity,
for the great omentum is the direct product of this redundant
growth of the mesogastrium caudad. It will be observed that
the great omentum is made up of four peritoneal layers, the folding
of the double-layered mesogastrium naturally producing this
result. The first or ventral and the fourth or dorsal layer are
derived from the original left layer of the primitive sagittal mesogastrium;
the intermediate second and third layers, separated
from each other at this stage by the cavity of the omental bursa,
are products of the primitive right leaf of the mesogastrium.
Since the entire retrogastric space with its extensions becomes the
&ldquo;lesser cavity&rdquo; of the human adult peritoneum, it will be seen
that its serous membrane is derived from the original right leaf
of the mesogastrium (second and third omental layers). After
the above-described adhesion of the mesogastrium to the parietal
peritoneum overlying the ventral surface of the left kidney, the
membrane would be traced in sagittal section (<a href="#Fig_179">Fig. 179</a>) from the
dorsal surface of the stomach caudad, lining the interior of the
omental bursa (second layer) to the turn or blind end of the<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
pouch; thence cephalad as the third omental layer, forming the dorsal
wall of the epiploic bursa, to invest, as secondary parietal peritoneum,
the cephalic segment of the ventral surface of the left kidney.</p>

<p class="center"><b>C. Development of Spleen and Pancreas in the Dorsal Mesogastrium
and Changes in the Disposition of the Great Omentum.</b></p>

<p>In order to obtain a correct conception of the adult human
conditions it is finally necessary to consider the development of
the spleen and pancreas in their connection with the dorsal mesogastrium
and to note the changes which are produced by adhesion
of portions of the great omentum to adjacent serous surfaces. It
will be advisable to discuss these subjects at first separately, and
to subsequently combine all the facts in an attempt to gain a correct
impression of their share in determining the disposition of
the adult human peritoneum.</p>

<p><b>1. Development of Spleen.</b>&mdash;The spleen develops from the mesoderm
between the layers of the dorsal mesogastrium, near its point
of accession to the greater curvature, in the region of the subsequent
fundus. It has therefore, like the stomach, originally free
peritoneal surfaces. After rotation of the stomach the organ lies
between the two layers of the membrane at the extreme left end
of the retrogastric space (Fig. 180).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 470px;">
<img src="images/fig180.jpg" width="470" height="192" alt="" />
<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_180"></a>Fig. 180.</span>&mdash;Schematic transverse section of the abdomen, showing early stage of development
of spleen from extreme left end of dorsal mesogastric pouch.
</div>

<p><b>Vascular Connections.</b>&mdash;The splenic artery accedes to the mesal surface
of the spleen from the vessel which originally passed directly
to the dorsal border (subsequent greater curvature) of the stomach,
between the layers of the mesogastrium.</p>

<p>With the further growth of the spleen the segment of this vessel
situated between its origin from the c&oelig;liac axis and the hilum of
the spleen becomes relatively larger, forming the adult splenic
artery, while the continuation of the original vessel to the greater
curvature of the stomach appears now as a branch of the splenic
artery, viz., the arteria gastro-epiploica sinistra.</p>

<p>Through the development of the spleen the dorsal mesogastrium
has been subdivided into a proximal longer vertebro-splenic, and
a distal shorter gastro-splenic segment. The former, as we have<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
seen, loses its identity as a free membrane in the human adult, by
fusing with the parietal peritoneum investing the ventral surface
of the left kidney. Hence, after this adhesion has taken place, the
splenic artery courses from the c&oelig;liac axis to the spleen behind
peritoneum which functions as part of the general parietal membrane,
but which is derived from the original right leaf of the
proximal vertebro-splenic segment of the primitive mesogastrium
(Fig. 181). On the other hand the distal segment of this membrane,
beyond the spleen, remains free, carrying, as the gastro-splenic
omentum, the left gastro-epiploic artery between its layers
from the splenic artery to the greater curvature of the stomach.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 520px;">

<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_181"></a>Fig. 181.</span>&mdash;Schematic transverse section of the abdomen, showing later stage of development
of spleen and arrangement of peritoneum after adhesion of dorsal layer of mesogastrium and
primitive prerenal parietal peritoneum.
</div>

<p>The lateral limit of the area of adhesion between mesogastrium
and parietal peritoneum is situated along the lateral border of the
left kidney. Hence, in the final condition of the parts, the main
splenic vessels at the hilum are situated between two peritoneal
layers of which the ventral (Fig. 181) appears as the parietal
peritoneum forming the dorsal wall of the retro-gastric space,
while the dorsal layer (Fig. 181) forms a reflection from the mesal
surface of the spleen, along the dorsal margin of the hilum, to the
adjacent lateral border of the left kidney (lieno-renal ligament)
and to the diaphragm. At this point of adhesion subsequently
firmer strands of connective tissue develop in the serous reduplication
forming the <i>ligamentum phrenico-lienale</i> of systematic anatomy.
This process of adhesion takes place during the second
half of intra-uterine life. A connection with the colon, produced
by adhesion of the mesogastrium to the splenic flexure of the
large intestine, forms the adult <i>lig. colico-lienale</i>, while a similar
adhesion between great omentum, transverse mesocolon and
phrenic parietal peritoneum just caudad of the spleen, gives rise to
the <i>colico-phrenic</i> or <i>costo-colic &ldquo;supporting&rdquo; ligament</i> of the spleen.</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, the ventral one of the two layers constituting
the gastro-splenic omentum and including between them the
left gastro-epiploic artery, is formed by the distal part of the
primitive left layer of the mesogastrium, while the dorsal layer
of the same fold is the portion of the primitive right layer be<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>yond
the spleen, which has not been converted into secondary
parietal peritoneum, but forms now part of the ventral wall of
the lesser peritoneal sac between the spleen and the stomach
(Fig. 181) (lig. gastro-lienale). Since, therefore, the gastro-splenic
omentum is a specialized part of the fully-developed dorsal mesogastrium,
and since we have seen that the great omentum is
formed directly by the excessive growth of this membrane caudad,
it is not difficult to understand why in the adult human
subject the ventral layer of the gastro-splenic omentum is directly
continuous with the ventral layer of the great omentum
along the greater curvature of the stomach to which both are
attached. The dorsal layer of the gastro-splenic omentum would,
in the same way, be continuous with the second layer of the great
omentum, lining the ventral wall of the omental bursa, if it were
not for the fact that in the adult adhesions usually obliterate the
cavity of the bursa.</p>

<p>Fig. 182 shows the stomach, left kidney, spleen and splenic
flexure of the colon hardened in situ and removed from the body
of a two-year-old child. The great omentum has been divided
along the line of adherence to the transverse colon.</p>

<p>In Fig. 183 the spleen has been removed from the preparation
by division of its peritoneal and vascular connections, and is
shown in its mesal aspect (gastric and renal surfaces, intermediate
margin and hilum). It will be seen that the peritoneal reflections are
arranged in the form of two concentric elliptical lines. The two
ventral lines form the gastro-splenic omentum and correspond to
the reflection of the peritoneum from spleen to left end of stomach
carrying the gastric branches derived from the splenic artery.
The third line from before backwards results from the division of
the secondary parietal peritoneum of the lesser sac, covering
splenic artery, and ventral surface of pancreas and derived from
the dorsal mesogastrium; while the most dorsal fourth line
represents the divided reflection of the peritoneum from the renal
surface of spleen to lateral border of left kidney and diaphragm
(lig. lieno-renale).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span></p>

<p>Between the second and third lines of peritoneal reflection appears
the portion of the mesal surface of the spleen in contact with
and invested by the extreme left end of the lesser peritoneal sac.</p>

<p><b>2. Development of the Pancreas.</b>&mdash;The pancreatic gland is derived
from the hypoblast of the enteric tube. The secreting epithelium
and that lining the ducts of the adult gland is formed by budding
and proliferation of the intestinal epithelium. The gland
develops primarily from two outgrowths which are at first separate
and distinct from each other.</p>

<p>1. The proximal and dorsal bud grows directly from the hypoblast
lining the duodenum immediately beyond the pyloric junction.</p>

<p>In embryos of 8&nbsp;mm. (four weeks) (Fig. 185) it appears as a
small spherical outgrowth connected by a slightly narrower stalk
with the epithelial intestinal tube.</p>

<p>2. The distal and ventral outgrowth is separated from the preceding
and is from the beginning closely connected with the
similar embryonic outgrowth from the enteric tube which is to
form the liver. This portion of the pancreas is, strictly speaking,
derived primarily from the epithelium of the primitive
hepatic duct and not directly from the duodenum. This primary
arrangement of the gland, being formed of two main collections
of budding hypoblastic cells, corresponds to the adult
system of the pancreatic excretory ducts. The proximal or dorsal
outgrowth furnishes that portion of the head of the gland
whose excretory system terminates in the <i>secondary pancreatic
duct</i> or <i>duct of Santorini</i>, while the distal (ventral) outgrowth
includes within its area the termination of the principal pancreatic
duct or <i>canal of Wirsung</i>, which is closely connected with
the end of the common bile-duct at the intestinal opening common
to both (Figs. 186-187). The method of union of the two
pancreatic outgrowths and their respective share in building up<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
the adult gland explains the usual adult arrangement of the
excretory system and its variations.</p>

<p>In the embryo of five weeks (Fig. 186) the two portions have
grown in length. The dorsal or proximal outgrowth, developing
between the layers of the mesoduodenum, is at this time the larger
of the two, composed of a number of glandular vesicles clustered
around the stalk represented by the parent duct.</p>

<p>The distal or ventral pancreatic growth, connected with the
liver duct, is as yet small and presents only a few vesicular appendages.
The duct of this portion empties in common with the
hepatic duct into the duodenum.</p>

<p>In embryos of the sixth to seventh week (Fig. 187), the two
glandular outgrowths have become connected with each other at a
point which corresponds exactly to the divergence of the duct of
Santorini from the main pancreatic duct (canal of Wirsung) in the
adult gland (Fig. 188).</p>

<p>The secondary pancreatic duct (of Santorini) of the adult corresponds
to that section of the proximal or larger embryonic outgrowth
situated between the intestine and the point where the
two glandular diverticula fuse with each other. Hence the canal
of Wirsung in the adult is a compound product. It includes the
duct system developed, in connection with the bile duct, in the
head of the gland, forming the intestinal termination of the main
duct. Its distal body portion on the other hand is derived from
the duct system of the originally larger proximal outgrowth, including
the entire peripheral portion which has become secondarily
added to the duct of the ventral outgrowth to form together with
it the canal of Wirsung. On the other hand the proximal portion
of the duct system of this originally larger part becomes secondarily
differentiated as the duct of Santorini.</p>

<p>Fig. 188 shows the normal adult arrangement of the pancreatic
and biliary ducts in a corrosion preparation of the canal.</p>

<p>The duct of Santorini in this case opened by a separate orifice
into the duodenum above the common opening of the biliary and

<p>If, notwithstanding this primitive arrangement, the distal duct
(canal of Wirsung) appears as the main pancreatic duct in the
adult, while the proximal (duct of Santorini) is secondary, this
depends upon a union of the products of the two outgrowths in
such a manner that the greater part of the duct system of the
proximal and larger portion is transferred to the distal duct to
form the adult canal of Wirsung, while the smaller segment of
the proximal duct, between its opening into the duodenum and
the point of fusion of the two outgrowths, forms the adult secondary
duct of Santorini. This duct opens usually into the duodenum
upon a small papilla situated about 2.5&nbsp;cm. above the
common duodenal termination of the bile-duct and canal of Wirsung
(papilla Vateri) (<a href="#Fig_193">Fig. 193</a>). The duct of Santorini usually
tapers toward the duodenal opening from its point of departure
from the main duct, its caliber gradually diminishing in the direction
indicated, so that it is smaller at the duodenal opening
than at the point of confluence with the main duct (Fig. 189).
Hence the secretion from the proximal head portion of the pancreas,
conveyed by this duct and its tributaries, passes usually into
the main pancreatic duct and not directly into the intestine
through the duodenal opening of the duct of Santorini. The
latter is, however, thus enabled to vicariously take upon itself
the conduct of the pancreatic secretion in cases of obstruction or
obliteration of the main duct (calculi, ulcers, cicatrices, etc.). In
these cases of obstruction of the main duct the duct of Santorini
enlarges and performs its functions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span></p>
<p>Occasionally, without obstruction of the main duct, the duodenal
opening of the duct of Santorini is large, and the flow of
secretion evidently the reverse of the usual, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, directly into
the intestine.</p>

<p>In other cases, also without pathological conditions, the proximal
duct is the larger of the two and serves as the principal
channel of pancreatic secretion, the canal of Wirsung being small.
This is evidently a persistence and further development of the
early embryonic relative condition of the two outgrowths above
described (Fig. 190). On the other hand the duct of Santorini
may not open at all into the duodenum, terminating in small
branches which drain the proximal part of the head of the gland
(Fig. 191).</p>

<p>Schirmer has examined the arrangement of the pancreatic ducts
in 105 specimens. In 56 of these the duct of Santorini passed
from the main duct into the duodenum, opening upon a papilla
situated 2.5&nbsp;cm. above the common opening of the bile duct and
canal of Wirsung.</p>

<p>In 19 the duct of Santorini was well developed but did not
open into the duodenum.</p>

<p>In but 4 cases the duct of Santorini formed the only pancreatic
duct, the lower opening being occupied by the bile duct alone
(Fig. 192). We may assume in these cases failure of development
of the distal outgrowth connected with the primitive hepatic
bud, leaving only the proximal duodenal outgrowth to form the
entire adult gland.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_188">Figs. 188</a> and <a href="#Fig_189">189</a> show the normal arrangement of the duodenal
openings of the biliary and pancreatic ducts.</p>

<p><b>Diverticulum and Papilla Vateri.</b>&mdash;From what has been said regarding
the embryonic union of the distal pancreatic outgrowth

features in the arrangement of the adult duodenal termination of<span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
the common bile-duct and canal of Wirsung. The dilated interior
of the duodenal papilla (diverticulum Vateri) corresponds to the
embryonic segment between the intestinal opening of the primitive
liver duct and the point when this duct gives off the distal
larger pancreatic outbud (<a href="#Fig_186">Figs. 186</a>, <a href="#Fig_187">187</a>, <a href="#Fig_188">188</a>, 193 and 194).</p>

<p>The union of the pancreatic and biliary ducts to form the recess
of the diverticulum Vateri, which then opens by a single common
orifice into the duodenum, is better marked in some of the lower
vertebrates than in man.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a> shows the proximal portion of the duodenum of the
cassowary (<i>Casuarius casuarius</i>) with the biliary and pancreatic
ducts and the diverticulum at their confluence in section.</p>

<p>The development of these two main digestive glands as diverticula
from the intestinal canal also explains the direct continuity
of the mucous membrane of their ducts with that lining the duodenum,
a fact which is of considerable importance in the pathological
extension of mucous inflammations from the intestine to
the duct system of the glands.</p>

<p><b>Development of the Pancreas in Lower Vertebrates.</b>&mdash;In the embryo
of the <i>sheep</i> two pancreatic buds are found, but the duct of
the dorsal (proximal) outgrowth (duct of Santorini) subsequently
fuses entirely with the main duct.</p>

<p>In the <i>cat</i> there are likewise two pancreatic outgrowths.</p>

<p>In the <i>chick</i> three pancreatic buds are visible about the fourth
day.</p>

<p><i>Amphibia</i> likewise present three embryonic pancreas buds.</p>

<p>The ventral (distal) outgrowth is double, the two portions proceeding
symmetrically from each side of the hepatic duct. The
single dorsal outgrowth is derived directly from the duodenal
epithelium. Later on all these outgrowths fuse to form the single
adult gland.</p>

<p><i>Fish</i> also possess several (up to four) embryonic pancreatic outgrowths.</p>

<p>Recently in human embryos of 4.9&nbsp;mm. cervico-coccygeal measure
three pancreatic outgrowths have been observed, all entirely<span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>
distinct from each other, one dorsal, budding from the epithelium
of the primitive duodenum and two ventral, proceeding from the
grooved gutter which represents the primitive ductus choledochus
at this period. In embryos of from 6 to 10&nbsp;mm. the two ventral
outgrowths have already fused, hence only two buds, a single
ventral and a dorsal, are now encountered.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>These observations place the development of the human pancreas
in line with the triple pancreatic outgrowths, two ventral
and one dorsal characteristic of the majority of the lower vertebrates,
which have been hitherto carefully examined. The ventral
or distal bud is probably double in the majority of vertebrates.
The two segments fuse, however, so early that the derivation of
the pancreas from a double outgrowth, as described above for the
human embryo, practically obtains. In forms in which the
adult gland presents a number of separate openings into the duodenum
(cf. <a href="#Page_118">p.&nbsp;118</a>), the development would probably show multiple
embryonic outgrowths from the intestinal hypoblast.</p>

<p>In any case the dorsal pancreatic bud appears to have developed
in the vertebrate series before the ventral outgrowth and to be
hence phylogenetically the older structure.</p>


<p class="center"><b>COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE PANCREAS.</b></p>

<p>With the exception of <i>Amphioxus</i> and probably also of the
<i>Cyclostomata</i>, the gland appears to be present in all vertebrates,
varying, however, much in size, shape and relation to the intestinal
tube. Usually it appears as an elongated, flattened, more or
less distinctly lobulated organ, in close apposition to the duodenum
between the layers of the mesoduodenum. In all forms
in which the gland is found it is connected with the post-gastric
intestine and marks the beginning of the midgut. In structure
the gland is usually acinous, resembling the salivary glands. It
is well developed in the selachians, forming a triangular body
connected with the beginning of the midgut (<a href="#Fig_202">Fig. 202</a>). In
some instances the gland elements do not extend beyond the in<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>testine itself, but remain imbedded in the wall of the midgut, as
in <i>Protopterus</i>. In certain adult teleosts the pancreas is surrounded
by the liver (Fig. 196), in others it does not appear as a
compact gland but is distributed in the form of finely scattered
lobules throughout the mesentery between the two layers of this
membrane. On account of this concealed position of the gland
it was formerly believed that the adult teleosts did not possess a
pancreas. The pyloric cæca (cf. <a href="#Page_119">p.&nbsp;119</a>) found in these forms were
consequently considered to be homologous with the pancreas of
the higher vertebrates.</p>

<p>In <i>Myxinoids</i> a peculiar lobulated glandular organ is found
imbedded in the peritoneal coat of the intestine near the entrance
of the bile-duct, into which its lobules open separately. This
organ possibly corresponds to the higher vertebrate pancreas.</p>

<p>An organ which may represent a dorsal pancreas is also developed
in <i>Ammoc&oelig;tes</i> (larva of <i>Petromyzon</i>), but its exact homology
is still doubtful. It is possible that a true pancreas has
not yet developed in the cyclostomata. In <i>Amphioxus</i> no trace
of a pancreas is found. In all other vertebrates the gland is
present. In certain amphibians, as the frog, the single pancreatic
duct opens into the common bile duct (<a href="#Fig_197">Fig. 197</a>).</p>

<p>In lacertilians and in some chelonians a lateral offshoot of the
pancreas is directed transversely and is adherent to the spleen.
<a href="#Fig_113">Fig. 113</a> shows the gland in <i>Chelydra serpentaria</i>. While the
gland usually has a single duct, yet two ducts are found in a
number of animals (many mammals, birds, chelonians and
crocodiles). At times three ducts are encountered, as in the
chicken and pigeon.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the pancreatic duct system among mammalia
presents the following variations:</p>

<p>1. Mammals with <i>one</i> pancreatic duct, either connected with
the bile-duct or entering the intestine independently:</p>

<p>Monkeys, most rodents (except the beaver), marsupials, carnivora
(except dog and hyena), many ungulates (pig, peccary,
hyrax, etc.), most ruminating artiodactyla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The pancreatic duct joins the common bile-duct before entering
the duodenum in the monkeys, marsupials, carnivora, in the
sheep, goat and camel.</p>

<p>The point of entrance of the combined duct into the intestine
varies. In some forms it is near the pylorus, in others at some
distance from the same. The common opening is situated 1&frac12;&#8243; to
2&#8243; beyond the pylorus in carnivora, and one foot behind the same
point in the goat and sheep.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The pancreatic duct does not join the bile-duct, but empties
separately into the intestine, in most rodents and in the calf and pig.</p>

<p>In the calf the pancreatic duct opens into the duodenum <ins
title="Transcriber's Note: This should probably be '15 inches' not '15
feet'. One reference source states that the bile duct opens into the
duodenum about 60&nbsp;cm from the pylorus and the pancreatic duct enters
about 30-40&nbsp;cm beyond the bile duct">15&#8242; beyond the bile-duct</ins> and
3&#8242; beyond the pylorus.</p>

<p>In the pig the pancreatic opening is 5&#8243;&ndash;7&#8243; beyond that of the
bile-duct and 6&#8243;&ndash;8&#8243; behind the pylorus.</p>

<p>2. Mammals with <i>two</i> pancreatic ducts, of which one usually
joins the bile-duct: perissodactyla (except the ass according to
Meckel), elephant, beaver, several carnivora, dog, hyena, and
according to Bernard the cat. In the perissodactyla the proximal
of the two pancreatic ducts empties, either combined with
the bile-duct, or separate from it, but very close to it, 3&#8243;&ndash;4&#8243; behind
the pylorus. The second distal duct is smaller and opens
several inches further down.</p>

entrance of biliary and pancreatic ducts. (Columbia University Museum, No. 1822.)
</div>

<p>In most rodents the pancreatic entrance is placed at some distance
from the pylorus. <a href="#Fig_199">Fig. 199</a> shows the arrangement of the
parts in the rabbit, in which animal the main distal pancreatic
duct empties at a distance of 13&#8243;&ndash;14&#8243; from the pylorus into the
end of the duodenum, which intestine forms a very long loop,
while the biliary duct, receiving the smaller proximal pancreatic
duct, opens near the pylorus.</p>

<p>In the <i>beaver</i> the smaller proximal duct joins the bile-duct or
even enters the duodenum anterior to the bile-duct, nearer the
pylorus, while the distal larger pancreatic duct opens into the intestine
16&#8243;&ndash;18&#8243; behind the biliary duct. Of the two ducts found
in the dog (<a href="#Fig_200">Fig. 200</a>) the smaller proximal either joins the bile-duct
or opens into the intestine close to it, 1&#8243;&ndash;1&frac12;&#8243; beyond the<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
pylorus. The larger distal duct opens into the duodenum 1&#8243;&ndash;1&frac12;&#8243;
behind the biliary duct. Fig. 201 shows the dog&rsquo;s stomach and
proximal portion of the duodenum in section. The proximal
smaller pancreatic duct here joins the biliary duct, and opens with
it by a single orifice into the duodenum. The distal larger pancreatic
duct opens independently into the intestine further caudad.</p>

<p>The parts in <i>Hyæna</i> present a similar arrangement.</p>

<p>Bernard always found <i>two</i> pancreatic ducts in the <i>cat</i>, one large
principal duct and a second smaller accessory duct. Of these, the
one situated nearest to the pylorus always united with the bile-duct.
The pancreatic duct thus joining the bile-duct was sometimes
the main duct, sometimes the accessory smaller duct.</p>

<p>Since the main function of the pancreatic juice is the conversion
of starch into sugar, the gland appears better developed in
general in herbivora than in carnivora, without, however, disappearing
in the latter. In fact it is of considerable size in the
carnivora, because the secretion also acts on the albuminous food
substances and, though to a lesser degree, on the fats.</p>


<p class="center"><b>PYLORIC CÆCA OR APPENDICES.</b></p>

<p>In the <i>Cyclostomata</i> and <i>Selachians</i> the intestinal canal is in the
main free from cæcal appendages, while a large portion of the

<p>On the other hand in the Ganoids and in many Teleosts longer

the summer flounder, with three well-developed conical pyloric

appendices is enormously increased, while their caliber diminishes.
Thus 191 cæcal appendages are found surrounding the
beginning of the midgut in <i>Scomber scomber</i>. A well-marked
example of prolific development of the pyloric appendages is
furnished by the common cod, <i>Gadus callarias</i> (Fig. 211). The
appendices are in the natural condition bound together by connective
tissue and blood vessels, so as to form a compact organ, resembling
a gland (Fig. 211, A), and a similar arrangement is found
in <i>Thynnus vulgaris</i> and <i>alalonga</i>, <i>Pelamys</i> and <i>Accipenser</i> (Fig. 212).</p>

<p>In the smaller upper figure on the left the stomach, mid-gut, and pyloric
cæca are seen in section, showing the lumen of the latter and their openings
into the mid-gut.</p>

<p>In some Teleosts (Siluroidea, Labroidea, Cyprinodontia, Plectognathi
and Leptobranchiates) the appendices are entirely wanting.
If there are not more than 8-10 appendices they usually surround
the gut and empty into the same in a circle. In other cases they
are arranged in a single line, or in a double row, opposite to each
other (<a href="#Fig_213">Fig. 213</a>). Each appendix may open into the intestine
independently, this especially where the number is limited and
the individual pouches large (cf. <a href="#Fig_206">Figs. 206</a>-<a href="#Fig_210">210</a>), or several may
unite to form a common duct.</p>

<p>Fig. 211, <i>B</i>, shows the appendices in <i>Gadus callarias</i>, the cod,
freed by dissection from the investing connective and vascular
tissue. It will be noticed that a considerable number of the tubes
unite to form ducts of larger caliber which open into the intestine,
as seen in the section shown in <a href="#Fig_214">Fig. 214</a>.</p>

<p>The pyloric appendices apparently have the same <i>significance</i> as
the spiral intestinal fold of the Selachians, Cyclostomes and Dipn&oelig;ans,<span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span> <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the production of an increase in the area of the digestive
and absorbing surfaces of the intestinal mucous membrane.
Hence, as stated, the appendices and the spiral fold are found to
vary in inverse ratio to each other. Thus, for example, <i>Polypterus</i>
(<a href="#Fig_205">Fig. 205</a>) still has a fairly well developed spiral fold and
only a single pyloric appendix, while <i>Lepidosteus</i>, with but slightly
developed spiral fold, has numerous appendices. It was formerly
held that the pyloric cæca and the pancreas were mutually incompatible
structures, and that where one is found the other will
be wanting.</p>

<p>Hence the appendices were regarded as homologous with the
pancreas of the higher forms. Recent observations have shown
that this view is not strictly and entirely correct, while at the
same time it merits consideration in several respects.</p>

<p>It is true that the pancreas in certain teleosts is now known to
be present although concealed from observation in the liver or
scattered in the form of small lobules between the layers of the
mesentery (cf. <a href="#Page_117">p.&nbsp;117</a>), and that in a number of fish, such as <i>Salmo
salar</i>, <i>Clupea harengus</i>, <i>Accipenser sturio</i>, both the appendices and
the pancreas are encountered. Consequently these structures
are not identical or even completely homologous, since they occur
side by side in the same form.</p>

<p>On the other hand Krukenberg has demonstrated that the appendices
pyloricæ may function physiologically as a pancreas by
yielding a secretion which corresponds to the pancreatic juice in
its digestive action. In the majority of forms, however, they apparently
merely increase the intestinal absorbing surface, secreting
only mucus.</p>

<p>These structures are nevertheless very interesting and instructive
since they furnish a perfect gross morphological illustration
of the embryonal stages just considered in connection with the
development of the mammalian pancreas. In the adult ganoid
or teleost these blind diverticula or pouches, varying greatly in
shape, number and size, protrude from the intestine immediately
beyond the pylorus, usually in close connection with the duo<span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>denal
entrance of the bile-duct. Two or more of these pouches
may unite to form a common duct or canal opening into the
intestine.</p>

<p>These forms, therefore, offer direct and valuable morphological
illustration of the manner in which the pancreas of the higher
vertebrates develops, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, as a set of hollow outgrowths or
diverticula from the hypoblast of the primitive enteric tube.
We can establish a consecutive series, beginning with forms in
which only one or two diverticula are found, and extending to
types in which the number of the little cylindrical pouches
reaches nearly two hundred and in which they are bound together
by connective tissue and blood vessels so as to closely
resemble the structure of a glandular pancreas. This is one of
the most striking instances in which the minute embryological
stages of the higher types are directly illustrated by the permanent
adult conditions found in the lower vertebrates. [The same
statement, as we will see, holds good in reference to the development
of the <i>liver</i>.]</p>


<p class="center"><b>RELATION OF THE PANCREAS TO THE PERITONEUM.</b></p>

<p>The gland becomes very intimately connected with the serous
layers of the primitive dorsal mesentery. In order to clearly
comprehend the adult serous relations it is necessary to make a
distinction between two divisions or portions of the gland, based
upon the altered relations of the primitive dorsal mesentery
which result from the differentiation of the primitive simple
intestinal tube into stomach and duodenum.</p>

<p>1. The primary outgrowth of the pancreatic tubules from the
duodenum, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the part which is to form the &ldquo;head&rdquo; of the
adult gland, is situated between the two layers of that division
of the primitive dorsal mesentery which forms, after differentiation
of stomach and small intestine, the <i>mesoduodenum</i>.
Coincident with the rotation of the stomach, as we have seen,
the duodenum and mesoduodenum exchange their original sagittal
position in the median plane of the body for one to the right<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
of the median line, balancing, so to speak, the extension of the
stomach to the left (<a href="#Fig_218">Fig. 218</a>).</p>

<p>The original right layer of the mesoduodenum and the right
surface of the duodenum now look dorsad and rest in contact
with the parietal peritoneum investing the right abdominal background
and the ventral surface of the right kidney and inferior
vena cava. We have already seen that the descending portion of
the duodenum in man becomes anchored in this position by adhesion
of these apposed peritoneal surfaces. This fixation includes,
of course, the structures situated between the layers of the
mesoduodenum, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the head of the pancreas. Consequently,
after rotation and adhesion, this portion of the gland turns one
surface ventrad, invested by secondary parietal peritoneum, originally
the left leaf of the free mesoduodenum, while the original
right surface of the gland has become the dorsal and has lost its
mesoduodenal investment by adhesion to the primary parietal
peritoneum.</p>

<p>2. In order to understand the way in which the body and tail
of the pancreas obtain their final peritoneal relations it is necessary
to consider the development of the dorsal mesogastrium to
form the omental bag. If we regard the primitive dorsal mesentery
in the profile view from the left side (Fig. 215) it will be seen
that, as already stated, the mesoduodenum is the first part of the
membrane to be invaded by the pancreatic outgrowth from the
intestine. Cephalad of the mesoduodenum the primitive dorsal
mesogastrium (Fig. 215) is seen to protrude to the left and caudad
to form, as already explained, the cavity of the omental
bursa of the retrogastric space (&ldquo;lesser peritoneal sac&rdquo;). The
further growth of the pancreas carries the developing gland from
the district of the mesoduodenum into that portion of the dorsal
mesogastrium which now forms the dorsal wall of the omental
bursa (Fig. 216).</p>

<p>This double relation of the pancreas to the mesoduodenum and
to the mesogastrium forming the omental bursa is well seen in
f&oelig;tal pigs between two and three inches in length (Fig. 217).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span></p>

<p>The head portion of the pancreas is seen developing between
the layers of the mesoduodenum, while the body and tail of the
gland, extending to the left, grows between the two dorsal layers
of the omentum bursa towards the spleen, which organ is found
connected with the left and dorsal extremity of the omental sac
derived from the dorsal mesogastrium.</p>

<p>Before the growth of the great omentum is pronounced the
continuity of the mesoduodenum and dorsal mesogastrium can
be readily appreciated (Fig. 218). But after the redundant
growth of the membrane has carried the great omentum further
caudad, the stomach and the two omental layers attached to
the greater curvature lie in front of the structures included
between the two dorsal layers and conceal them from view (<a href="#Fig_177">Fig.

<p>In sagittal sections to the left of the median line (Figs. 221 and
222) the pancreas now appears included between the layers of the
great omentum near their point of departure from the vertebral
column. (This point is of course identical with the prevertebral
attachment of the primitive dorsal mesogastrium from which the
omentum is developed.)</p>

<p>The foregoing considerations will, therefore, lead to the conclusion
that the pancreas presents, in regard to its peritoneal relations,
two distinct segments:</p>

<p>1. The portion adjacent to duodenum (head and neck of
the gland) is developed between the layers of the mesoduodenum.</p>

<p>2. The distal portion of the gland, comprising the body and
tail, develops between the layers of the great omentum (dorsal
segment), derived from the primitive dorsal mesogastrium.</p>

<p>The transections of the dorsal mesogastrium shown in <a href="#Fig_180">Figs.
180</a> and <a href="#Fig_181">181</a> will now have to be amplified by the introduction of
the body of the pancreas between the two layers of the vertebro-splenic
segment, in addition to the splenic artery (<a href="#Fig_219">Figs. 219</a> and
<a href="#Fig_220">220</a>).</p>

<p>Hence the following facts will be understood:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span></p>

<p>1. In the adult the splenic artery supplies a series of small
branches to the pancreas as it courses along the cephalic border of
the gland on its way to the spleen.</p>

<p>2. After the above-described adhesion of the original left leaf
of the dorsal mesogastrium (vertebro-splenic segment) to the
parietal peritoneum (<a href="#Fig_220">Fig. 220</a>), the dorsal surface of the body
of the pancreas loses its peritoneal investment and becomes
attached by connective tissue to the ventral surface of the left
kidney.</p>

<p>3. The ventral surface of the body of the pancreas is in the
adult lined by peritoneum of the &ldquo;lesser sac&rdquo;; in other words
the organ has practically assumed a &ldquo;retro-peritoneal&rdquo; position,
its ventral peritoneal covering appearing now as the dorsal parietal
peritoneum of the retro-gastric space.</p>

<p>4. When completely developed the extreme end (tail) of the
pancreas extends to the left, following the splenic artery, until it
touches the mesal aspect of the spleen at the hilus.</p>

<p>5. If we, therefore, leave out of consideration for the moment
the transverse colon and duodenum, which will be taken up
presently, and confine ourselves to the arrangement of the
stomach, pancreas and great omentum, a sagittal section
to the left of the median line would result as shown in
Fig. 222, after the adult condition of adhesion has been established.</p>

<p>The same process of fixation, which resulted in the anchoring of
duodenum and head of pancreas, extends to the body of the gland
and the investing omentum. The peritoneum lining the original
left, now the dorsal surface of the gland, fuses with the primitive
parietal peritoneum covering the diaphragm and the left kidney.
The main body of the pancreas in the adult appears prismatic,
giving a triangular sagittal section. The dorsal surface is adherent
to the ventral surface of the left kidney; the ventral surface is
covered by the secondary parietal peritoneum (original right layer
of mesogastrium) which lines the dorsal wall of the retrogastric
space and omental bursa (lesser peritoneal sac). The great omen<span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>tum
now appears to take its dorsal point of departure along the
sharp margin which separates this ventral surface of the pancreas
from a third narrower surface directed caudad. This surface,
under the conditions which we are at present examining,
would be lined by the peritoneum continued onto it from the
dorsal layer of the great omentum. This peritoneum merges
along the dorsal margin of this caudal surface of the pancreas
with the general parietal peritoneum covering the left lumbar
region and the caudal part of ventral surface of the left kidney.
We have, therefore, along this line a secondary transition
from visceral to parietal peritoneum, obtained by the
obliteration of the original visceral peritoneum investing the
dorsal surface of the pancreas before adhesion to the parietal
peritoneum.</p>

<p>The pancreas assumes, therefore, in the adult a secondary retro-peritoneal
position, covered on its ventral surface by peritoneum
of the &ldquo;lesser sac,&rdquo; while the caudal surface is lined by part of
the general peritoneal membrane of the &ldquo;greater sac.&rdquo; The dorsal
surface, denuded of serous covering by obliteration, is adherent
to the crura of the diaphragm, the aorta and the ventral surface
of the left kidney.</p>

<p>It is now proper to compare the conclusions just derived from
the study of the development of the human dorsal mesogastrium
and connected structures (spleen and pancreas) with the conditions
presented by the corresponding parts in one of the lower
mammalia, which illustrate some of the human embryonal
stages. Here again the abdominal cavity of the cat forms an
instructive object of study.</p>

<p>The purpose of the following comparison should be twofold:</p>

<p>I. The mesogastrium, spleen and pancreas in the cat will
clearly illustrate the process of human development above outlined.</p>

<p>II. The abdominal viscera of the cat, if properly arranged,
will enable us to complete the consideration of this region by including
the very important relations which the transverse colon<span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
and third portion of the duodenum bear in man to the great
omentum and pancreas.</p>


<p class="center"><b>I. SPLEEN, PANCREAS AND GREAT OMENTUM OF CAT.</b></p>

<p>After opening the abdominal cavity it will be seen that the
great omentum can be lifted up, exposing the subjacent coils of
the small and large intestine, to which it adheres at no point.
In other words the entire dorsal surface of that part of the original
mesogastrium which forms the great omentum is free. It will be
remembered that this is not the case in the adult human subject,
because here the dorsal surface of the great omentum adheres to
the transverse colon. Consequently in man only that portion of
the dorsal surface of the omentum can be seen which extends
between the transverse colon and the caudal free edge of the
membrane.</p>

<p>It will be noted that on the left side the spleen is connected by
its mesal surface to the omentum and through it with the stomach
(gastro-splenic omentum). In other words the cat illustrates the
human embryonal stage in which the spleen has appeared between
the layers of the dorsal mesogastrium at the extreme left or blind
end of the retrogastric pouch formed by the rotation of the stomach
and elongation of the mesogastric membrane, but <i>before</i> the adhesion
has taken place between the original <i>left</i> (now <i>dorsal</i>) layer
of the vertebro-splenic segment of the mesogastrium and the
primitive parietal peritoneum apposed to it (<a href="#Fig_219">Fig. 219</a>). Consequently
the dorsal wall of the &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; sac in the cat is still
composed of the two layers of the free vertebro-splenic segment
of the mesogastrium, the primitive right (now ventral) layer not
having been converted, as is the case in man, into secondary
parietal peritoneum by adhesion of the original left (now dorsal)
layer to the primitive prerenal parietal peritoneum.</p>

<p>If we now examine the relation of the pancreas to the peritoneum
we can establish the following facts:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/fig223.jpg" width="460" height="397" alt="" />
<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_223"></a>Fig. 223.</span>&mdash;Abdominal viscera of cat, hardened and removed from body, showing relation of
pancreas to mesoduodenum and dorsal mesogastrium, respectively. (Columbia University
Museum, No. 728.)
</div>

<p>1. The portion of the gland adjacent to the duodenum, corresponding
to the &ldquo;head&rdquo; of the human organ, is included between<span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>
the two layers of the mesoduodenum. This membrane is free,
so that the dorsal surface of this portion of the pancreas is seen
to be invested by the dorsal layer of the mesoduodenum (Fig.
223). The duodenum and the mesoduodenum, the latter containing
the head of the pancreas between its layers, can be turned
toward the median line, so as to expose the entire ventral surface
of the post-cava and right kidney. To illustrate the arrangement
which is found in the adult human subject the descending
duodenum and pancreas should be allowed to fall over to the
right so as to cover the vena cava and the mesal part of the ventral
surface of right kidney. The adult human condition will now be
produced if we assume that the structures are fixed in this position
by the obliteration of the apposed serous surfaces, viz., the
parietal peritoneum over kidney and vena cava on the one hand
and the right layer of the mesoduodenum and the dorsal visceral
peritoneum of the duodenum on the other.</p>

<p>2. In following out the pancreas of the cat in its entire extent,
proceeding to the left of the pylorus, it will be seen that the
body of the gland has extended between the two dorsal layers
of the great omentum (primitive dorsal mesogastrium) over to
the spleen (Fig. 223). Consequently the arrangement in the
cat corresponds to the stage in the human development shown
in <a href="#Fig_219">Fig. 219</a> and <a href="#Fig_221">Fig. 221</a> in which adhesion of the dorsal surface
of the pancreas to the parietal peritoneum has not yet taken place.</p>

<p>It will be quite easy to reconstruct from the facts as demonstrated
by the arrangement of the parts in the cat, the stage in
the development of the lesser peritoneal sac in which the dorsal
wall of the space is still formed by the proximal portion of the
free dorsal mesogastrium (great omentum) and the structures included
between its two layers.</p>

<p>It must then become apparent that the entire serous surface
which in the adult human subject we regard as &ldquo;parietal peritoneum
of the lesser sac&rdquo; lining the dorsal wall of the retrogastric
space is derived from what originally was the right layer of the
primitive sagittal dorsal mesogastrium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span></p>


<p class="center"><b>II. RELATION OF GREAT OMENTUM TO TRANSVERSE COLON,
TRANSVERSE MESOCOLON AND THIRD PART OF DUODENUM.</b></p>

<p>The second purpose to be accomplished by the study of the
cat&rsquo;s abdominal cavity at this stage is the correct appreciation of
the adult human conditions which are produced by areas of adhesion
between the transverse colon, transverse mesocolon and
third part of the duodenum on the one hand, and the dorsal
mesogastrium, as great omentum, with the structures contained
between its layers, on the other.</p>

<p>Perform the manipulations of the large and small intestine in
the cat (see <a href="#Page_67">p.&nbsp;67</a>) which are required in order that the tract may
be arranged so that it will correspond in general to the topographical
conditions presented by the adult human subject.
Locate the transverse colon and mesocolon and the third portion
of the duodenum produced by these manipulations in imitation
of the corresponding human structures. Then proceed to plot
the different parts out successively as they would appear in a
sagittal section (Fig. 224).</p>

<p>The following facts are to be noted and indicated on the plan
of the section:</p>

<p>1. The great omentum is free, hanging down from the greater
curvature of the stomach over the coils of intestine. Turning the
omentum up it will be observed that the body of the pancreas is
included between the two dorsal layers of the membrane.</p>

<p>2. The omentum, containing the pancreas, can be lifted up,
exposing the next succeeding structure, viz., the transverse colon
and mesocolon. In the cat the large intestine has been brought
over, by the manipulations above indicated, into a transverse position
so as to represent the human transverse colon and its mesocolon.
It is therefore necessary to remember that in this mammal
the fixation of the transverse mesocolon in the position indicated,
by adhesion of ascending and descending mesocola to the parietal
peritoneum of the abdominal background, has not yet occurred.
Consequently the membrane must be held in the transverse position
in order to represent the human arrangement.</p>

<p>It will of course be observed that both surfaces of the transverse
mesocolon established in this way are free, not adherent to either
omentum or pancreas on the one hand, nor to the transverse duodenum
on the other.</p>

<p>3. The third or transverse portion of the duodenum is seen to
be attached by the distal part of the mesoduodenum, both of the
serous surfaces of the membrane being free. The duodenum having
been brought from right to left transversely across vertebral
column and aorta, underneath the superior mesenteric artery, the
mesoduodenum, in the segment corresponding to the transverse
duodenum, exchanges its original sagittal position for one in a
horizontal plane, with cephalic (primitive left) and caudal (primitive
right) surfaces.</p>

<p>Now compare the above arrangement of the intestines and
peritoneum in the cat at once with the conditions presented in the
adult human subject, reserving certain intermediate stages, as exhibited
by some of the lower monkeys, for subsequent study.</p>

<p>The examination of a similar sagittal section representing schematically
the adult human arrangement of the parts (Fig. 225) will
reveal the following points of difference as compared with the cat:</p>

<p>1. The peritoneum covering the dorsal surface of the pancreas,
derived from the primitive dorsal mesogastrium, has become
adherent to the parietal peritoneum, as previously described.</p>

<p>2. The cephalic surfaces of the transverse colon and mesocolon
fuse with the corresponding area of the dorsal (4th) layer
of the great omentum (dorsal mesogastrium).</p>

<p>In the human f&oelig;tus in the 4th month the connection is still
so slight that the omentum can readily be separated from the
transverse colon and mesocolon.</p>

<p>Further dorsad the cephalic layer of the transverse mesocolon
adheres to the serous investment of the caudal surface of the
pancreas, derived, as we have seen, from the same dorsal layer
of the great omentum.</p>

<p>3. The duodenum and mesoduodenum are fixed by adhesion
on the one hand to the parietal peritoneum, on the other to the<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
caudal layer of the transverse mesocolon near the root of that
membrane.</p>

<p>4. The cavity of the omental bursa is usually obliterated in the
adult caudad of the level of the transverse colon, by adhesion of
the apposed surfaces of the two intermediate omental layers.</p>

<p>We have therefore three general areas of secondary peritoneal
adhesion to deal with (Fig. 225), viz.:</p>

<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_226"></a>Fig. 226.</span>&mdash;Schematic sagittal section of adult human peritoneum.
</div>

<p>These areas of adhesion result naturally in the production of
secondary lines of peritoneal transition as follows:</p>

<p>1. Figs. 225, 1; 226, 1, from the omentum, dorsal layer, to the
caudal surface of transverse colon, caudal layer of transverse mesocolon
and caudal surface of the pancreas.</p>

<p>2. Figs. 225, 2; 226, 2, from the caudal layer of the transverse
mesocolon across the transverse portion of the duodenum
to the parietal peritoneum and mesentery of the jejuno-ileum.</p>

<p>3. Figs. 225, 3; 226, 3, between the intermediate omental layers,
forming the secondary caudal limit of the lesser sac.</p>

<p>These changes consequently result in the rearrangement of the
adult human peritoneum in accordance with the following
schema (Fig. 226):</p>

<p>We trace the peritoneum as the ventral or superficial layer of
the great omentum from the greater curvature of the stomach
caudad around the distal free edge of the omentum and cephalad,
as the dorsal layer, to the ventral border of the transverse colon.<span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
Here apparently this layer is continued across the caudal surface of
the large intestine and beyond as the caudal layer of the transverse
mesocolon. While this condition obtains practically in the adult
it is to be remembered that the adhesion (at 1 in Fig. 225) prevents
us from lifting the omentum away from the colon, and that
consequently the apparent continuity of the dorsal layer of the
great omentum with the caudal layer of the transverse mesocolon
is the result of this peritoneal fusion.</p>

<p>Near the dorsal attachment or &ldquo;root&rdquo; of the transverse mesocolon
the caudal layer of the membrane becomes continuous
with the parietal peritoneum investing the transverse portion of
the duodenum on its ventral aspect, which peritoneum in turn
passes into the free mesentery of the jejuno-ileum (Fig. 225, 2).
Comparison with the previous figures will show that we are dealing
here with another area of secondary peritoneal fusion.</p>

<p>If we now open the &ldquo;lesser peritoneal cavity&rdquo; by dividing the
two layers of the omentum attached to the greater curvature of
the stomach (Figs. 225 and 226 in direction of arrow) we will
apparently reach the upper or cephalic surface of the transverse
mesocolon. This layer can be followed dorsad to the sharp
border which separates the ventral and caudal surfaces of the
pancreatic body and the membrane can be traced thence over the
ventral surface of the gland to the diaphragm. (The connections
with the liver and stomach shown schematically in the diagram
(<a href="#Fig_225">Fig. 225</a>) are to be considered in detail subsequently.)</p>

<p>In the adult the peritoneal surface just described appears as the
cephalic layer of the transverse mesocolon and its continuation
dorsad. From the facts previously considered it will be at once
apparent that we are really dealing here with a part of the third
layer of the primitive omentum. We do not see the original
cephalic layer of the transverse mesocolon. This membrane has
become fused with the fourth omental layer, and its free serous
surface obliterated in the stretch between the vertebral column
and the transverse colon. Hence the human adult transverse
mesocolon is apparently composed of <i>two</i> layers; the cephalic of<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
these layers appears as peritoneum of the &ldquo;lesser sac,&rdquo; in conformity
with its derivation from the original third omental layer lining
the interior of the omental bursa. The caudal layer, on the other
hand, is a part of the general or &ldquo;greater&rdquo; peritoneal membrane.
The entire adult transverse mesocolon, hence, comprises <i>four</i> peritoneal
layers, of which only two remain as permanently free
serous surfaces. These differ in their derivation, the cephalic
layer being a part of the primitive dorsal mesogastrium (third
omental layer), while the caudal layer is part of the primitive
mesocolon. Between these two layers of the adult transverse
mesocolon are included the two obliterated embryonic membranes,
<i>viz.</i>, the fourth omental layer and the original dorsal layer
of the transverse mesocolon.</p>

<p>Caudad the two layers of the adult transverse mesocolon surround
the transverse colon and are continuous along the ventral
margin of the intestine with the layers of the great omentum.
Toward the vertebral column these layers again diverge. The
cephalic layer, lining the &ldquo;lesser peritoneal cavity&rdquo; invests the
ventral surface of the pancreas. The caudal layer continues over
the caudal surface of the body of the gland and transverse portion
of the duodenum into the parietal peritoneum and the free mesentery
of the jejuno-ileum. Consequently the returning layers
of the great omentum are said to surround the transverse colon
and unite along the dorsal border of the intestine to form the
transverse mesocolon, which membrane is continued dorsad toward
the vertebral column as two layers. At the &ldquo;root&rdquo; of the
transverse mesocolon these layers are then described as diverging,
the cephalic passing up to line the ventral surface of the pancreas,
while the caudal continues over the caudal surface of the pancreas
and third portion of the duodenum into the parietal peritoneum
and mesentery.</p>

<p>Wherever in this discussion of the transverse mesocolon the
transition between the caudal layer of the membrane and the
&ldquo;parietal&rdquo; peritoneum is referred to it is necessary to remember
that this &ldquo;parietal&rdquo; peritoneum is the <i>secondary</i> investment of<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
the abdominal background, formed by the surface of the ascending
and descending mesocolon which remains free after the opposite
surface and the vertical segments of the large intestine have
been anchored by adhesion to the <i>primary</i> parietal peritoneum
(cf. <a href="#Page_81">p.&nbsp;81</a>, <a href="#Figs_157_158">Fig. 158</a>).</p>

<p>A summary at this point of the course of the dorsal mesogastrium,
in forming the great omentum and its subsequent connections,
would show us that the membrane first enlarges and descends
towards the transverse colon (<a href="#Fig_177">Fig. 177</a>). The omental
bag is formed by the descending or superficial segment (starting
from the greater curvature of the stomach), turned toward the
observer in the figure, and by the ascending or deep layer which
is attached above to the dorsal abdominal wall, in front of the
vertebral column and aorta along the original line of origin of
the dorsal mesogastrium. Gradually growing and descending
further, the deep segment becomes attached to the transverse
colon. It also becomes connected, especially on the left side, with
the diaphragmatic peritoneum (phrenicocolic lig.), so that its
original starting point is no longer distinct. Finally the development
of the spleen and pancreas between the layers of the dorsal
segment and their subsequent connections obscure the original
conditions.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_297">Fig. 297</a> shows the primitive condition at a time when the connection
with the transverse colon and mesocolon has not yet
taken place.</p>

<p>The omental bag or bursa epiploica develops in the region of
the dorsal mesogastrium and the viscera included between its
layers, by changes in the position and extent of the membrane
which finally result in placing a part of the right half of the
primitive c&oelig;lom cavity behind the stomach. Up to the sixth week
the line of origin of the dorsal mesogastrium is from the mid-dorsal
line of the abdomen. It deviates from this origin to the
left because the great curvature of the stomach to which it is
attached turns in this direction. On this account, and because of
the rapid growth of this portion of the mesogastrium, a bag or<span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>
space is formed behind the stomach. The entrance into this space
is situated to the right of the lesser curvature, behind the peritoneal
layers connecting the same with the liver (lesser or gastro-hepatic
omentum and hepato-duodenal ligament). The ventral
wall of this space is formed by the dorsal surface of the stomach
itself, the dorsal wall by the mesogastrium, turning to the left
and presenting its original right surface, now directed ventrad.
The caudal limit of the retro-gastric space is given by the turn of
the mesogastrium to reach its attachment along the greater curvature
of the stomach (rudiment of great omentum).</p>

<p>The stomach, in contributing to produce these changes, passes
from the vertical to the oblique and finally into the transverse
position. The pylorus, formerly directed caudad, passes up and
to the right. The fundus develops and the original left side of
the stomach becomes the ventral, the right side the dorsal. The
original dorsal border, now the greater curvature, moving caudad,
carries the attached dorsal mesogastrium with it into its new
position. The mesogastrium now pouches to form the great
omentum and rapidly enlarges. At first hardly projecting beyond
the greater curvature, it increases in length until it forms
a four-layered apron which hangs down as a loose sac over the
transverse colon and the coils of the small intestine (<a href="#Fig_177">Fig. 177</a>).
In the f&oelig;tus of six months the cavity of the omental bag extends
caudad as far as the lower edge of the omentum. Later
adhesions between the peritoneal surfaces lining the interior of
the bursa limit this extension.</p>

<p>The omental bursa is therefore formed by a ventral lamella,
consisting of two peritoneal layers, which hangs down from the
greater curvature of the stomach and passes around the caudal
free edge of the omentum into the double-layered dorsal lamella,
which ascends, over the transverse colon, to the original starting
point of the dorsal mesogastrium along the front of the vertebral
column and aorta. Hence the &ldquo;great omentum&rdquo; is originally
composed of four layers of peritoneum.</p>

<p>The dorsal double lamella becomes adherent over a consider<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>able
area to the parietal peritoneum of the dorsal abdominal wall.
In this way the organs developed between the two layers of the
lamella obtain their final fixed position. The pancreas becomes
anchored and appears in the adult as a &ldquo;retro-peritoneal&rdquo; structure,
while the spleen is attached by the &ldquo;phrenico-lienal ligament&rdquo;
to the diaphragm.</p>

<p>In addition the dorsal omental lamella adheres in the fourth
month to the cephalic layer of the transverse mesocolon and to
the transverse colon.</p>

<p>Important illustrations of some of the intermediate stages in the
human development of this portion of the peritoneal tract are
afforded by the permanent adult conditions found in the abdominal
cavity of some of the lower primates, notably certain of the
cynomorphous monkeys.</p>

removed. (Columbia University Museum, No. 63/1831.)
</div>

<p>Fig. 227 shows the abdominal cavity and disposition of the
peritoneum in a macaque monkey (<i>Macacus rhesus</i>, &#9794;) in the ventral
view, with the coils of small intestines removed and the omentum
lifted up and reflected upon the ventral body wall. The following
important points of difference from the arrangement in the
<i>cat</i> on the one hand, and in <i>man</i> on the other, are to be noted:</p>

<p>1. The large intestine presents the typical primate course, with
an ascending, transverse and descending colon. The ileo-cæcal
junction is situated in the right iliac fossa.</p>

<p>2. The ascending and descending mesocola are still <i>free</i>, not
having become adherent to the parietal peritoneum along the
dorsal abdominal wall. Hence the caudal portions of the ventral
surfaces of the two kidneys are still covered by the <i>primitive
parietal peritoneum</i>.</p>

<p>3. The great omentum is not yet adherent to the transverse
colon and mesocolon except for a short distance on the extreme
right. At this point the dorsal layer of the omentum has begun
to contract adhesions to the hepatic flexure of the colon and ascending
colon, but the rest of the transverse colon is free. Differing
from the human arrangement is a line of adhesion,
uniformly present in these monkeys, between the dorsal surface<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
of the omentum along its right edge and the ventral surface
and right border of the <i>cæcum</i> and <i>ascending colon</i>, parts which
normally are not adherent to the omentum in man.</p>

<p>4. Hence in tracing the omentum to the left of the limited
adhesion to the hepatic flexure and ascending colon, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, nearly
throughout the entire extent of the transverse colon, we find
the membrane passing freely without adhesion over the cephalic
surface of the transverse mesocolon, which preserves its original
free condition, independent of the omentum. This arrangement
is shown in the schematic sagittal section in Fig. 230.</p>

<p>5. Tracing the omentum dorsad beyond the transverse colon
and mesocolon the pancreas is reached. Here we encounter the
first extensive area of omental or mesogastric adhesion. The
omental peritoneum continues over the ventral and caudal surfaces
of the gland, investing the same, but the dorsal surface has
lost its serous covering and is anchored to the ventral surface of
the left kidney. Hence a sagittal section would show the arrangement
of the monkey&rsquo;s omentum as indicated in the schematic
Figs. 229 and 230. Making now a general comparison of the
peritoneal membrane of this animal with that of man, and of both
with the preceding common embryonal condition, we can draw
the following conclusions, indicated schematically in the five
figures 228-232.</p>

<p>1. The dorsal layer of the monkey&rsquo;s omentum in its proximal
segment behaves in the same way as in man, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, it becomes adherent
to the primitive parietal peritoneum down as far as the
caudal margin of the dorsal surface of the pancreas included between
the primitive mesogastric layers forming by their further
growth the omental apron.</p>

<p>Therefore we find, as in the human subject,</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The pancreas adherent to the ventral surface of the left
kidney.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A portion of the ventral surface of the kidney, cephalad of

<p>2. The monkey differs from adult man in the behavior of the

<p>Hence we have in this animal the following conditions:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The omentum is non-adherent to the transverse colon and
transverse mesocolon.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The caudal surface of the pancreas is lined by its original
mesogastric peritoneum.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The transverse mesocolon is formed by the original two
layers of the primitive dorsal mesentery; hence its cephalic layer
is not &ldquo;peritoneum of the lesser sac&rdquo; as is the case in man.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The caudal part of the ventral surface of the left kidney
below the pancreas, is covered by the original parietal peritoneum.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Only one point or line of <i>secondary peritoneal transition</i> exists,
where the dorsal layer of the omentum in the adult becomes continuous
with the parietal peritoneum covering the caudal surface
of the pancreas and the ventral surface of the left kidney.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>: In the schematic sections shown in <a href="#Fig_228">Figs. 228</a> to <a href="#Fig_232">232</a> the
transverse colon is represented as far removed from the ventral surface
of the left kidney, in order to make the peritoneal lines of the
mesocolon more clear. Actually a sagittal section which would
divide the kidney would cut the transverse colon at its extreme
left end, where it turns close to the ventral surface of the left kidney
and then follows its lateral border to form the splenic flexure
(<a href="#Fig_235">Fig. 235</a>). The caudal part of the ventral surface of the left
kidney in the adult human subject is covered by the peritoneum
which, as secondary parietal peritoneum, is derived from the
upper part of the right leaf (later ventral leaf) of the descending
mesocolon. Hence it should be remembered that these diagrams
present <i>combinations</i> of sections. A section which will show the
full development of the transverse mesocolon is mesad of the<span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
kidney; while a section through the kidney would be too far laterad
to show the transverse mesocolon.</p>

<p>Figs. 233, 234 and 235 show sagittal sections through the left
kidney with the adult arrangement of the peritoneum and colon
and the embryonic and adhesion stages leading to the same.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in all the schematic sections of the
early embryonic stages the two layers of the transverse mesocolon
are shown without dorsal attachment, as turning with the formation
of a fold (<a href="#Fig_228">Fig. 228</a> at x) into two layers descending ventrad
of the parietal peritoneum. This is because the dorsal attachment
of the mesocolon is at this stage still in the median line
and would hence not be encountered by a sagittal section through
the kidney, and because the two layers of the transverse mesocolon,
immediately after rotation of the large intestine, are still
directly continuous with the two layers of the descending mesocolon.
That is to say, the cephalic layer of the transverse mesocolon
is continuous with the dorsal (originally the left) layer of
the descending mesocolon, and the caudal layer of the transverse
mesocolon with the ventral (originally the right) layer of the
descending mesocolon, which is, in the human subject, to assume
subsequently the character of parietal peritoneum after the dorsal
layer and the primitive parietal peritoneum have become obliterated
by adhesion (Fig. 235).</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_236">Fig. 236</a> shows this continuity of the descending and transverse
mesocolon as a permanent adult condition in the macaque. The
fold of transition between the two is seen at x in <a href="#Fig_228">Fig. 228</a>. It
will be noticed that the ventral surface of the left kidney, caudad
of the adherent pancreas, is covered by the primitive parietal
peritoneum, corresponding to section in <a href="#Fig_230">Fig. 230</a>.</p>


<p class="center"><b>RELATIONS OF SPLEEN AND OMENTUM IN</b> <i>MACACUS RHESUS</i>.</p>

<p>The spleen in this animal has not contracted any extensive
adhesions to the parietal peritoneum (the phrenico-lienal lig.
of anthropotomy is not developed). It can be turned mesad so
as to expose the lateral border and an adjacent segment of the<span class="pagenum" title="140"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
ventral surface of the left kidney, as well as the dorsal surface of
the tail of the pancreas at its tip, still covered by mesogastric

vertebro-splenic segment of the mesogastrium, including the pancreas,
to the primitive parietal peritoneum is less complete than
in man.</p>

<p>Fig. 236 shows the abdominal viscera, hardened in situ, of
<i>Macacus cynomolgus</i>, the Kra monkey, in the ventral view and

<p>The great omentum is lifted up, the pancreas is adherent to the
ventral surface of the left kidney, the caudal portion of which is
covered by the primary parietal peritoneum, which can be exposed
by turning the still free descending mesocolon mesad. The
mesocolon retains its primitive attachment to the median line
ventrad of the large prevertebral blood vessels. It is readily seen
that adhesion between the left leaf of this free descending mesocolon
and the parietal peritoneum down to the level of the
iliac crest would produce the conditions found in the human
adult, with an attached descending colon and a free sigmoid flexure;
also that limited adhesion of the mesocolon of the sigmoid
flexure to the parietal peritoneum would produce, as previously
explained (cf. <a href="#Page_97">p.&nbsp;97</a>), the intersigmoid peritoneal fossa.</p>

<p><b>2. Ventral Mesogastrium and Liver.</b>&mdash;The peritoneal reflections
from the stomach to the liver, and the arrangement of the
membrane in connection with the latter organ, remain for consideration.</p>

<p>Certain complicated adult conditions, encountered in this part
of the abdominal cavity, make it desirable to arrange the subject
for purposes of study under the following subdivisions:</p>

<p>I. The development of the liver and of its vascular system,
and the significance of the adult circulation of the liver and of
the f&oelig;tal remnants connected with the organ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span></p>

<p>II. The anatomy of the ventral mesogastrium and the changes
produced in the arrangement of the membrane by the development
of the liver.</p>

<p><b>I. A. Development of the Liver.</b>&mdash;The liver, like the pancreas, is
developed from the duodenum as an outgrowth from the hypoblast
lining the enteric tube. As we have previously noted, the
first outgrowth of the hepatic diverticulum is closely associated
with the distal pancreatic outbud; in fact the latter arises as a
derivative from the hepatic duct rather than as a distinct outbud
from the intestinal tube. (This close association of the hepatic
duct with the pancreas is well seen in the arrangement of the
concealed pancreas of some teleosts (cf. <a href="#Page_117">p.&nbsp;117</a>, <a href="#Fig_196">Fig. 196</a>).)</p>

<p>In point of time the liver is the first accessory structure to
develop by budding from the primitive alimentary canal, the
pancreas and lung following.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">

<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_237"></a>Fig. 237.</span>&mdash;Longitudinal section of an embryo of <i>Petromyzon
planeri</i>, four days old. (Minot, after Kupffer.)
</div>

<p>In the primitive type of development, as seen in <i>Petromyzon</i>
and in the Amphibia, the liver appears very early, as a diverticulum
of the embryonic intestinal tube, near its cephalic extremity,
projecting on the ventral aspect down into the mass of
yolk-cells (Fig. 237). The short stretch of the primitive alimentary
canal cephalad of the hepatic diverticulum corresponds to
the foregut. With the development of the heart the primitive
foregut becomes divided into pharynx and post-pharyngeal segment
(&oelig;sophagus and stomach). The hepatic diverticulum then
lies immediately dorsad of the caudal or venous extremity of the
heart. Hence it is probable that the liver is an older organ in
the ancestral history of the vertebrates than the pharynx or even
the heart. The liver diverticulum lies in close connection with
the omphalo-mesenteric veins which return the blood from the
yolk-sac to the heart. In the course of further development, as
will be seen below, the liver comes into very intimate relations
with the venous circulation.</p>

<p>In human embryos of 3.2&nbsp;mm. the primitive hepatic duct appears
as a wide hollow pouch composed of hypoblast cells, growing
between the two layers of the ventral mesogastrium, which<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
membrane, extending between the ventral border of the primitive
stomach and the ventral abdominal wall, will be subsequently
considered in detail. The liver, in developing between the layers
of the ventral mesogastrium, approaches very early the <i>septum
transversum</i> or rudimentary diaphragm and becomes connected
with the same. A mass of mesodermal cells, derived from the
mesogastrium and from the primitive mesodermal intestinal
wall surrounding the hypoblastic lining of the tube, covers the
cæcal termination of the primitive hepatic duct, forming the so-called
embryonic <i>hepatic ridge</i>. This mesodermal tissue accompanies
the duct in its further growth and branching, forming the
connective tissue envelope, known in the adult as the capsule of
Glison. The primitive hepatic duct is directed cephalad in the mesogastrium
between the vitelline duct and the stomach (<a href="#Fig_101">Fig. 101</a>).</p>

<p>In embryos measuring 4.25&nbsp;mm. the duct is 0.24&nbsp;mm. long.
Later (in embryos of 8&nbsp;mm.) the primitive single duct divides
into two secondary branches, indicating, even at an early stage,
the adult arrangement of the duct, as formed by the union of the
right and left hepatic ducts (<a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>).</p>

<p>The gall-bladder in embryos of this size (8&nbsp;mm.) is a well-defined
cæcal diverticulum, branching caudad from the main
hepatic duct.</p>

<p>The vesicular mucous surface is thus derived from the enteric
hypoblast in the same way as the epithelial lining of the bile-ducts
and capillaries. The external muscular and fibrous coats
of the gall-bladder are developed from the mesoderm of the
mesogastrium.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that at an early stage the gall-bladder is derived
from the main duct close to the intestine, the latter duct
being very short. Later on the common duct grows in length,
making the liver more and more a gross anatomical organ distinct
from the intestine. The cystic duct develops as the result
of a similar increase in length of the cystic diverticulum. The
two principal secondary branches of the hepatic duct give origin
to sprouts or buds. These are derivatives of the hypoblastic<span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
cells of the larger ducts and may from the beginning be hollow,
possessing a lumen continuous with that of the parent duct
(Selachians, Amphibians). In warm-blooded animals these
sprouts are at first solid, forming the s. c. <i>hepatic cylinders</i>, and
only subsequently become hollowed out with the further development
of the biliary duct system of the liver. The rapid
growth of the organ leads to a great increase in the number of the
hepatic cylinders. They spread out on all sides, finally coalescing
with adjacent buds so as to form an interlacing network whose
meshes are filled by blood vessels. After the hepatic cylinders
have become canalized they preserve the same arrangement,
hence the resulting biliary capillaries of the adult form an anastomosing
network. Amphioxus and the amphibians have a
single hepatic outgrowth (<a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a>).</p>

<p>In the Selachians the liver arises as a ventral outgrowth at
the hinder end of the foregut immediately in front of the vitelline
duct, thus bringing the liver from the beginning into close proximity
with the vitelline veins entering the heart. Almost as soon
as formed the outgrowth develops two lateral diverticula, opening
into a median canal. The two diverticula are the rudimentary
lobes of the liver and the median canal uniting them is the
rudiment of the common bile-duct and gall-bladder.</p>

<p>In the Teleosts the liver arises quite late (in the trout about the
25th day) as a solid outgrowth from the intestinal canal close to
the heart. In the Amniota the liver arises in the same position
as in the Anamnia, but, at least in birds and mammals, shows its
bifurcation almost, if not quite, from the start. The two forks
embrace between them the omphalo-mesenteric or vitelline veins
just before they empty into the sinus venosus of the heart.</p>

<p>In the chick the liver appears between the 56th and 60th hour,
the right fork being always of greater length but less diameter
than the left. The hepatic outbud in the rabbit appears during
the 10th day, and during the 11th day begins to send out branches.</p>

<p>In man, as above stated, the bud appears well marked in embryos
of 3&nbsp;mm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span></p>

<p>[Certain adult variations make it appear possible that there are
two human embryonic hepatic buds, a cranial and a caudal, as is
the case in birds.]</p>

<p><b>I. B. Comparative Anatomy of the Liver.</b>&mdash;The liver, phylogenetically
a very old organ, occurs in all vertebrates, for the cæcal
diverticulum of the intestine of amphioxus (<a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a>) has probably
the significance of a hepatic outbud.</p>

<p>The primitive form of the liver is symmetrically bilobed, a
type which is seen well in the chelonian organ (Fig. 238).</p>

<p>In size the liver is subject to great variations. It is usually
larger in animals whose food contains much fat. Hence carnivora
in general have a larger liver than herbivorous animals.</p>

<p>Its shape also varies considerably, depending on the form of the
body cavity and on the amount and disposition of the available
space. Hence in the snakes the organ appears long drawn out,
flattened, almost ribbon-like (Fig. 239), while the relatively very
large coronal diameter of the body cavity in the turtles permits
the liver to expand transversely (Fig. 238).</p>

<p>In general, when the liver is large and the available space for its
reception limited, it is usually split into several (two to seven)
lobes, which permit, by mutual displacement, the accommodation
of the organ to varying space-conditions of the body cavity (Fig.
240). Under the opposite circumstances, on the other hand,
even the primitive bilobed character may disappear and the liver
is then unlobed (Fig. 241).</p>

<p>The presence or absence of a gall-bladder depends apparently
largely on the character of the food and on the habitual
type of digestion. In many vertebrates digestion is carried on
nearly continuously, without marked interruption, especially in
many ungulates, ruminants and rodents. In such animals the gall-bladder
is absent. It is also absent in several birds (most Parrots,
Doves, Ostrich, Rhea americana, the Cuculidæ, Rhamphastos,
etc.). This variability emphasizes the morphological fact that
the biliary bladder is only a modified portion of the hepatic duct
system, as shown by the development above outlined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span></p>

<p>A great variety is observed in the arrangement of the biliary
ducts, through which, at the period of intestinal digestion, bile
passes from the liver and gall-bladder into the intestine, while in
the intervals of digestion the secretion is only carried from the
liver to the bladder. The following main types of the biliary
duct system may be recognized:</p>

<p>1. The hepatic duct joins the cystic to form the common bile-duct,
entering the duodenum by passing obliquely through the
intestinal wall (Fig. 242). This form is encountered in man
and in most mammals. It is also found in some birds (<i>Buceros</i>),
many amphibians, and in some fish (<i>Lophius</i>). Instead of one
hepatic duct two may join the cystic duct separately to form the
common bile duct (<i>Phoca litorea</i>), or the number of hepatic ducts
may be further increased. The separate hepatic ducts then
unite successively with the cystic duct. This occurs in many
mammals (as <i>Tarsius</i>, <i>Galeopithecus</i>, monotremes) and in some
fishes (<i>Xiphias</i>, <i>Trigla</i>, <i>Accipenser</i>) (Fig. 243).</p>

<p>2. Of two hepatic ducts only one helps to form with the cystic
duct the common duct, while the other leads from the liver transversely
into the bladder, especially into the neck, forming the
hepatico-cystic duct (Fig. 244). This arrangement is found in
several mammals (calf, sheep, dog).</p>

<p>3. No common bile-duct is formed. The hepatic and cystic
ducts each empty separately into the intestine (hepato-enteric and
cysto-enteric ducts), while a hepato-cystic duct carries the bile
directly from the liver to the gall-bladder (Fig. 245).</p>

<p><i>Lutra vulgaris</i> among mammalia, the majority of the birds and
several reptilia present this type.</p>

<p>When the gall-bladder is absent a single large hepato-enteric
duct is found, or instead a number of smaller ducts which enter
the intestine successively.</p>

<p><b>I. C. Development of Vascular System of Liver.</b>&mdash;In order to comprehend
the peritoneal relations of the adult liver it is absolutely
necessary to have a clear understanding of the development of
the vascular system in connection with the gland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span></p>

<p>For our purpose, in the first place, a serial consideration of the
successive stages, illustrated by schematic diagrams, will prove
most practicable. These diagrams represent the structures in the
dorsal view, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, in the position which they would occupy in the
adult liver with the gland resting on its upper or convex surface
and with the ventral sharp margin turned toward the beholder
(see <a href="#Fig_259">Fig. 259</a>).</p>

<p>The development of the venous system, especially in connection
with the liver, presents a somewhat complicated series of successive
conditions. After having become familiar with the principal
typical embryonal stages, as shown in the following diagrams,
the student is strongly recommended to cement this knowledge
by the comparative examination of the venous system. The permanent
veins of the lower vertebrates, while in many cases not
strictly homologous to those of the higher forms, yet are excellent
objects for study, since they serve to illustrate temporary stages in
the development of the mammalian venous system, and to that
extent are of aid in comprehending one of the most difficult and
important chapters in human anatomy. At the conclusion of the
diagrammatic consideration of the mammalian development a
number of comparative facts will be put together for this
purpose.</p>

<p><b>1. Early Stage.</b>&mdash;In the earlier developmental stages in mammalian
embryos the primitive dorsal aorta extends caudad along the
ventral aspect of the vertebral axis, giving off paired vitelline or
omphalo-mesenteric arteries to the yolk-sac and allantoic arteries
to the embryonic urinary bladder or allantois (Figs. 246 and 247).</p>

<p>The blood is returned from the vascular area of the yolk-sac by
two vitelline or omphalo-mesenteric veins, which unite near the
heart to form a common trunk, continued as the <i>sinus venosus</i> into
the caudal or auricular extremity (venous end) of the primitive
tubular heart (Figs. 246, 247 and 248).</p>

<p><b>2. Development of Allantois. Stage of Placental Circulation.</b>&mdash;The placental
circulation, replacing the temporary vitelline circulation
of the earliest stages, is inaugurated by the appearance of two<span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
umbilical veins, which pass cephalad, imbedded in the tissue of
the ventral mesogastrium, to empty into the sinus venosus near
the vitelline veins (Fig. 249). The umbilical veins return the
oxygenated blood from the placenta to the embryo. At first the
right umbilical vein is the larger of the two.</p>

<p>The sinus venosus at this time also receives two large veins,
transversely directed, called the ducts of Cuvier, which are formed
near the heart by the union of the anterior cardinal (primitive
jugular) and posterior cardinal veins, draining respectively the
head end of the embryo, and the body walls and Wolffian bodies.</p>

<p>The vitelline veins are placed on each side of the primitive
small intestine, and become connected with each other by a broad
anastomotic branch (Fig. 249). When the hepatic outgrowth buds
from the duodenum the vitelline veins send out branches which
break up into a wide-meshed capillary network in the mesodermic
tissue enveloping the hepatic cylinders. Hence at this period
the circulation in the vitelline veins is made up of three districts:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Distal segment of veins, coursing along duodenum, and
joined by a transverse anastomosis, before reaching the liver bud
(subintestinal veins).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Middle segment, from which capillary vessels are derived,
ramifying upon and between the developing hepatic cylinders.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Proximal segment, formed by the continuation of the proximal
part of the vitelline veins into the sinus venosus of the heart.</p>

</div>

<p><b>3. Formation of Portal Circulation. A.</b>&mdash;With the further development
of the liver the direct connection of the distal segment of
the vitelline veins with the sinus venosus becomes lost, the intermediate
segment being entirely broken up into an intrahepatic
network (Fig. 250). Hence all the blood brought to the liver
by the vitelline veins (venæ hepaticæ advehentes) passes through
the hepatic capillary circulation, before it is carried by the proximal
segment of the vitelline veins (venæ hepaticæ revehentes)
into the sinus venosus. The amount of this blood increases with
new connections which the vitelline veins make with the venous
radicles developing in the intestinal tract and its appendages.<span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
In proportion as, with the development of the placenta and reduction
of the yolk-sac, the original significance of the vitelline
veins as nutritive and respiratory vessels disappears, this secondary
connection of the vitelline veins with the veins of the alimentary
tract becomes more and more important, until finally
the original vitelline veins, now properly called omphalo-mesenteric
veins, return the blood from the intestinal tube, pancreas
and spleen to the liver.</p>

<p>The venæ hepaticæ advehentes, becoming connected in this
way with the developing intestine, pancreas and spleen, form the
rudiments of the future portal system, while the venæ hepaticæ
revehentes are prototypes of the hepatic veins of the adult circulation.</p>

<p><b>B. Development of the Portal Vein.</b>&mdash;The distal subintestinal segments
of the vitelline veins are early united by a transverse anastomotic
branch. The section of the veins above this anastomosis
is seen already in Fig. 250 to have assumed an annular shape,
while the veins below the primary anastomosis are approaching
each other to form a second ring-like junction.</p>

<p>In Fig. 251 the subintestinal segments of the two vitelline veins
are seen to have communicated with each other by transverse
anastomotic branches around the duodenum, two of these
branches being situated ventrad and one dorsad of the intestinal
tube. These branches, and the portions of the primitive vitelline
veins between their points of derivation, form two vascular loops
or rings, encircling the primitive duodenum (Fig. 251).</p>

<p>The distal portions of the vitelline veins, before reaching the
caudal annular duodenal anastomosis, next fuse into a single longitudinal
vessel which also receives the veins from the stomach,
intestine, spleen, and pancreas, and forms the beginning of the
portal vein.</p>

<p>By atrophy of the right half of the lower, and of the left half
of the upper duodenal venous ring (Figs. 252 and <a href="#Fig_253">253</a>), the proximal
portion of the portal vein is formed as a single vessel, taking
a spiral course around the duodenum (<a href="#Fig_256">Fig. 256</a>). Hence in the<span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>
adult the portal vein and its principal branch (the superior mesenteric
vein) crosses over the ventral surface of the duodenum (third
portion), turns along the mesal side of the second portion, and
then continues to the liver along the dorsal aspect of the first
portion (<a href="#Fig_254">Fig. 254</a>). <i>Note</i>&mdash;In comparing <a href="#Fig_254">Fig. 254</a> with the schematic
figures it should be noted that the same presents the parts
in the <i>ventral</i> view, while the schemata offer the <i>dorsal</i> aspect.</p>

<p><b>4. Changes Leading to the Final Arrangement of the Umbilical Veins.</b>&mdash;A
very important rearrangement of the umbilical veins takes place.
These veins originally course in the lateral abdominal wall, close
to the fold of the amnion (<a href="#Fig_255">Fig. 255</a>), and then turn cephalad of
the developing liver along the septum transversum to empty into
the sinus venosus at each end (<a href="#Fig_249">Figs. 249</a> and <a href="#Fig_250">250</a>). The right
umbilical vein is at first the larger.</p>

<p>This symmetrical arrangement, and the direct connection of the
umbilical veins with the sinus venosus, now becomes lost by the
occurrence of the following changes:</p>

<p>1. At first (<a href="#Fig_249">Fig. 249</a>) all the blood carried to the liver by the
omphalo-mesenteric veins passes through the hepatic capillary
network before being conducted by the venæ revehentes to the
sinus venosus. Very early, however, a new intrahepatic channel
develops, the ductus venosus (<a href="#Fig_250">Figs. 250</a>-<a href="#Fig_253">253</a>), which passes obliquely
between the entrance of the left omphalo-mesenteric vein
into the capillary system (l. v. advehens) and the termination of
the right omphalo-mesenteric vein (r. vena revehens) in the sinus
venosus.</p>

<p>In human embryos of 4&nbsp;mm. the ductus venosus can already
be distinguished, and in embryos of 5&nbsp;mm. the vessel has assumed
considerable proportions.</p>

<p>2. A communication is next established on both sides between
the capillary hepatic network in the portion of the liver nearest
to the abdominal wall and the umbilical veins as they ascend
imbedded in the abdominal wall (<a href="#Fig_251">Fig. 251</a>).</p>

<p>This connection is usually from the start larger on the left side
and connects with the left omphalo-mesenteric vein just at the<span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>
point where the same is about to be continued into the ductus
venosus. This connection becomes rapidly larger, so that the
ductus venosus, which at first appeared merely as an anastomotic
channel between the left omphalo-mesenteric vein and the terminal
portion of the right omphalo-mesenteric vein, now forms the
main continuation of the left umbilical vein. This vessel grows
very rapidly up to its connection with the ductus venosus and
soon exceeds the right umbilical vein in size (Fig. 252). Beyond
the ductus venosus on the other hand the proximal segment of
the left umbilical vein diminishes in size, and loses its independent
character by incorporation in the hepatic circulation. Only
its terminal portion, emptying into the sinus venosus, is preserved.
This is surrounded by the growing masses of hepatic
cylinders and is converted into a vena revehens.</p>

<p>The connection of the right umbilical vein with the liver vessels
is at first symmetrical to that on the left side, but less
strongly developed. The effect of this connection is to reduce
in the same way the proximal segment of the right umbilical
vein and to convert its termination into a vena revehens. With
the great development of the left vein, however, the vein on the
right side gradually diminishes and finally loses its connection
with the intrahepatic circulation altogether. The right umbilical
vein is now reduced to a vessel of the ventral abdominal wall,
which carries blood in the reverse of the original direction, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
from the abdominal wall caudad <i>into</i> the left umbilical vein
(Figs. 253 and <a href="#Fig_255">255</a>).</p>

<p>The connection thus established between the umbilical vein
and the portal circulation results in the formation of a single
large (the original left) umbilical vein which, throughout the
remainder of f&oelig;tal life, returns all of the placental blood (Fig.
253).</p>

<p>The newly developed hepatic portion of the left umbilical vein
becomes, however, not only connected with the ductus venosus,
but also with the right part of the upper venous ring, derived
from the right omphalo-mesenteric vein (Fig. 253). This con<span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>nection
forms the left portal vein of the adult, and enlarges
rapidly.</p>

<p>The terminations of the ductus venosus and of the venæ hepaticæ
revehentes undergo a number of secondary changes in
relative position. The left hepatic vein loses its direct connection
with the sinus venosus, and now opens into the termination
of the ductus venosus, into which the right hepatic vein also
empties. This common vessel (v. hepatica communis) subsequently
forms the proximal segment of the postcava when this
vessel develops (Fig. 256).</p>

<p>The blood, therefore, returned to the liver by the left umbilical
vein divides at the transverse fissure into three streams. Two of
these pass through the connection with the portal vein and through
branches developed from the hepatic part of the umbilical vein
into the capillary system of the right and left lobe. The third
continues through the ductus venosus to the common hepatic vein
and sinus venosus (<a href="#Fig_256">Fig. 256</a>). The ductus venosus thus becomes
the chief vessel returning arterialized placental blood to the heart.
When the postcava develops fully the hepatic segment of this
vessel also joins the terminal part of the ductus venosus (<a href="#Fig_256">Fig.
256</a>) and gradually replaces the same as the main returning
venous channel, the proximal part of the ductus venosus being
incorporated in the vena cava (<a href="#Fig_257">Fig. 257</a>). The postcava then
receives the right hepatic veins separately, while the left hepatic
veins and ductus venosus open together into the main vein. This
condition obtains up to the time of birth and the consequent
interruption of the placental circulation.</p>

<p>While at first the ductus venosus communicates throughout its
entire length with the meshwork of the hepatic capillary system,
a separation into two segments, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, ductus venosus proper and
intrahepatic segment of umbilical vein, is established after the free
communication with the left umbilical vein takes place. This
condition is exhibited in <a href="#Fig_258">Fig. 258</a>, which represents the corroded
venous system of the f&oelig;tal liver, and in <a href="#Fig_259">Fig. 259</a>, showing an

<p><span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span></p>
<p>It will be observed that the umbilical vein on entering the liver
gives off a large branch to the left lobe, and a smaller branch on
the right side to the quadrate lobe, which act as the main venæ
advehentes of these portions of the liver. Arrived at the transverse
fissure the umbilical vein divides into three branches, at
right angles to each other. The left branch enters the left lobe,
the right branch becomes directly continuous with the left main
division of the portal vein, while the central branch, continuing
the direction of the umbilical vein, passes dorsad, as the ductus
venosus proper, to join the left hepatic vein close to its entrance
into the postcava.</p>

<p><b>5. Changes Consequent upon the Establishment of Pulmonary Respiration.</b>&mdash;After
birth the umbilical vein and its continuation, the ductus
venosus, become obliterated, the former constituting the round
ligament of the liver, the latter the ligament of the ductus venosus,
both structures imbedded in corresponding portions of the sagittal
fissure on the caudal and dorsal surfaces of the adult liver
(<a href="#Fig_284">Figs. 284</a> and <a href="#Fig_286">286</a>). The lateral branches of the umbilical vein,
however, in its course from the ventral margin of the liver to the
transverse fissure (<a href="#Fig_258">Fig. 258</a>), remain pervious and are transferred
to the portal circulation.</p>

<p>It will be noticed, in reference to the <i>direction</i> of the blood current,
that at birth a sudden reversal takes place in the right terminal
branch of the umbilical vein at the transverse fissure (<a href="#Fig_260">Figs.
260</a> and <a href="#Fig_261">261</a>). Before birth the blood current of the umbilical
vein divides into three streams, right, left and central. The latter
enters the ductus venosus. The left enters the liver directly, the
right traverses, from left to right, the segment between the termination
of the umbilical and the bifurcation of the portal vein.
This segment in the adult carries blood from right to left, as left
branch of the portal vein. In the f&oelig;tus, however, the blood
traverses this segment from left to right, in passing from the
umbilical to the right branch of the portal vein. The blood
entering the liver through the portal vein passes chiefly into the
right division of that vessel (<a href="#Fig_260">Fig. 260</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span></p>

<p>After birth all the venous blood entering the liver passes
through the portal vein. In the right division the direction of
the current is the same as in the f&oelig;tus.</p>

<p>On the left side, however, the current is now from right
to left, from the bifurcation of the portal into the channels of
the left lobe formerly connected with the umbilical vein (<a href="#Fig_261">Fig.
261</a>).</p>

<p>Hence the direction of the current in this segment is reversed
at birth.</p>


<p class="center"><b>SUMMARY OF HEPATIC CIRCULATION.</b></p>

<p>The foregoing consideration of the development shows us that
the hepatic circulation presents successively three main stages:</p>

<p><b>1. Omphalo-mesenteric or Vitelline Stage</b>, which results in the
laying down of the primary capillary circulation of the liver and
in the establishment of its connection with the developing veins
of the alimentary tract (primitive portal channels).</p>

<p><b>2. Umbilical or Placental Stage</b>, in which the greater part of the
blood circulating through the liver is oxygenated blood returned
from the placenta by the umbilical vein, accounting for
the rapid growth and relatively large size of the organ during
f&oelig;tal life.</p>

<p>The placental blood uses the preformed capillary channels of
the vitelline or primitive portal system in the liver, and the same
rapidly extend and enlarge with the accelerated growth of the
gland. During this stage venous blood is also returned from the
alimentary tract to the liver by the portal vein, produced by
fusion of the distal segments of the primitive vitelline veins and
their secondary connection with the mesenteric, splenic and pancreatic
veins (omphalo-mesenteric development of primitive vitelline
veins).</p>

<p><b>3. Adult or Portal Stage.</b>&mdash;With the interruption of the placental
circulation the portal vein assumes again its original position as
the only vein carrying blood to the liver. With the establishment
of intestinal digestion and absorption this vessel grows
rapidly in size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span></p>
<p class="center"><b>COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE HEPATIC VENOUS
CIRCULATION.</b></p>

<p>For the purpose of fixing the main facts in connection with the
development of the higher mammalian hepatic circulation, and
in order to obtain a demonstration of the cycle through which the
different veins pass, the student is recommended to examine, preferably
by personal dissection, a limited series of lower vertebrates
which can be readily procured and easily injected. The following
series has been selected, but it will be understood that other
forms can be substituted, according to the local conditions which
govern the supply of the material.</p>

<p>4. <i>Bird.</i> The common fowl.</p>

<p>5. Human f&oelig;tus at term.</p>

<p><b>1. Fish.</b>&mdash;The venous system can be injected by tying a canula
in the lateral vein, and injecting both cephalad and caudad, or by
injecting cephalad through the caudal vein. The injection of the
systemic veins can also be made caudad through one of the ducts
of Cuvier, combined with an injection cephalad of the caudal
vein.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/fig262.jpg" width="450" height="452" alt="" />
<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_262"></a>Fig. 262.</span>&mdash;Diagram of the veins of a selachian. (Wiedersheim, after Parker.)

<p>The lateral vein arises from a venous network surrounding the cloaca, receiving one or more
cutaneous veins of the tail, veins of the body-wall, and veins of the pelvic fins.</p>

<p>The caudal vein divides at the posterior end of the kidney into the two renal-portal veins,
from which the advehent veins of the renal-portal system are derived. The revehent renal-portal
veins join to form the posterior cardinal veins, which, after dilating enormously to form the
cardinal sinuses, join with the anterior jugular, subclavian, and lateral veins to form the ducts of
Cuvier. The latter receive the inferior jugular veins, from the deep parts of the head and neck
and the terminations of the hepatic portal system (hepatic sinus).</p>

<p>The hepatic portal vein is formed by the veins of the &oelig;sophagus, stomach, and intestines.
After traversing the capillary vessels of the liver, the revehent hepatic veins unite to form an
extensive hepatic sinus before entering the heart.</p>
</div>

<p>The following main facts are to be noted in the venous system
of the Selachian (Fig. 262):</p>

<p><b>1. There are Two Portal Systems.</b> (<i>a</i>) <i>Renal Portal System.</i>&mdash;The caudal
vein divides near the vent into two branches which course
along the lateral border of the kidneys, sending <i>afferent</i> or <i>adve<span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>hent</i>
veins into the organ. The blood traverses the renal capillaries
and is gathered together by the <i>efferent</i> or <i>revehent</i> veins,
which empty into median paired vessels, the posterior cardinals.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Hepatic Portal System.</i>&mdash;The veins of the digestive tract and
appendages unite to form a hepatic portal vein. The blood after
traversing the capillary system of the liver is collected by hepatic
veins, which form a dilated hepatic sinus emptying into the sinus
venosus of the heart.</p>

<p>2. The middle segment of the intestine, presenting a spiral
valve in the interior, gives rise to a vein emptying into the portal
vein which corresponds to the subintestinal vitelline vein of the
mammalian embryo (<a href="#Fig_202">Fig. 202</a>).</p>

<p>3. The posterior cardinal veins, also greatly dilated and forming
the posterior cardinal sinus, join, near the heart, the veins returning
blood from the head, the anterior cardinal or jugular, to form
a transversely directed trunk, the duct of Cuvier, which empties
into the sinus venosus at the auricular extremity of the heart.
Into the duct of Cuvier empties on each side a <i>lateral vein</i> returning
the blood from the body walls. This vein can be considered,
for our present purpose, as representing in general the abdominal
vein of amphibians and reptiles, and the umbilical vein of the
mammalian embryo.</p>

<p>The adult selachian venous system is therefore to be considered
as illustrating the following conditions above encountered in
our study of the embryology of the mammalian venous system.</p>

<p>1. The heart illustrates excellently the stage in the mammalian
development, in which auricular and ventricular segments have
differentiated, but before the division of the cavities into a pulmonary
and systemic portion by the development of the auricular
and ventricular septa and the division of the arterial trunk
into pulmonary artery and aorta.</p>

<p>The sinus venosus still exists, as an ante-chamber to the auricular
cavity proper, receiving on each side the ducts of Cuvier,
which represent the fusion product of the systemic veins, anterior
and posterior cardinal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span></p>

<p>2. The hepatic portal circulation corresponds to the mammalian
stage in which the vitelline veins have become omphalo-mesenteric
by joining the intestinal veins.</p>

<p>The spiral vein remains as a portion of the original vitelline
vein corresponding to the subintestinal segment of the mammalian
embryo (cf. <a href="#Fig_248">Figs. 248</a> and <a href="#Fig_249">249</a>).</p>

<p>The selachian portal vein represents the united vitelline veins,
into which the veins of the digestive tract open.</p>

<p>In the liver we find a simple system of venæ advehentes, derived
from the branching of the portal vein, a hepatic capillary
network, and venæ revehentes, the proximal remnants of the
original vitelline veins which carry the liver blood to the sinus
venosus. The condition of the hepatic circulation corresponds
therefore to the stage shown in <a href="#Fig_250">Fig. 250</a> of the mammalian development.
There is as yet no association of the hepatic venous
system with the representative of the umbilical vein (the lateral
vein of the selachian).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/fig263.jpg" width="440" height="428" alt="" />
<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_263"></a>Fig. 263.</span>&mdash;Diagram of the veins of urodele amphibian (<i>Salamandra maculosa</i>). (Wiedersheim.)

<p>The caudal vein bifurcates at the posterior extremity of the kidneys to form the afferent
trunks of the renal-portal system along the lateral border of the kidneys, from which the advehent
veins of the renal-portal system are derived. The iliac or femoral vein divides into an
anterior and a posterior branch, the latter opening into the afferent renal-portal vein, while the
former, uniting with the one of the opposite side, forms the abdominal vein, and receives vessels
from the bladder, cloaca, and end-gut. The revehent veins of the renal-portal system, emerging
upon the ventral surface of the kidneys, empty into a single median vessel, the distal or renal
section of the postcava or vena cava inferior. Proceeding cephalad, the proximal or hepatic section
of this vessel, after traversing the liver and receiving the revehent hepatic veins of the
hepatic portal system, empties into the sinus venosus of the heart. Previous to entering the liver
the postcava gives off the two posterior cardinal or azygos veins, which continue cephalad, receiving
tributary segmental veins from the body-walls and reach the sinus venosus by joining the
subclavian veins. These latter uniting with the anterior cardinal (jugular) veins form the ducts
of Cuvier (precaval veins).</p>

<p>The abdominal vein continues cephalad in the ventral mesogastrium to the liver, giving off a
number of smaller branches, which enter the hepatic portal circulation by penetrating the ventral
surface of the liver between the layers of the ventral mesogastrium, while the main continuation
of the vessel joins the hepatic portal vein at its point of entrance into the liver.</p>

<p>The hepatic portal vein is formed by tributaries returning the blood from the digestive tract
(intestinal canal, spleen, pancreas). The blood, after traversing the hepatic portal circulation, is
conducted by the hepatic revehent veins to the proximal section of the postcava. A number of
secondary or accessory portal veins pass from the anterior portion of the intestinal canal (&oelig;sophagus,
stomach) directly to the liver.</p>
</div>

<p>The postcava has been divided at the cephalic end of the liver just before entering the sinus
venosus, and the postcardinals have been cut prior to their junction with the subclavian veins.</p>

<p>The stomach has been turned caudad. The abdominal vein has been divided after the common
trunk has been formed by branches from the iliac veins. The latter are seen entering the
afferent renal-portal vein, derived from the bifurcation of the caudal vein, along the lateral
border of the kidneys.</p>

<p>The junction of the main trunk of the abdominal vein with the hepatic portal vein takes
place close to the liver under cover of the pancreas. A series of accessory portal veins continuous
with the abdominal vein enter the ventral surface of the liver between the layers of the ventral
mesogastrium. The inter-renal segment of the postcava receives the revehent renal-portal veins.
The iliac vein enters the advehent renal-portal veins derived from the caudal vein.</p>

</div>

<p>3. The lateral veins, which we can, as stated, regard for purposes
of illustration, without prejudging their genetic significance,
as representing the mammalian embryonic umbilical veins, still
present the condition corresponding to the early mammalian
embryonal stage shown in <a href="#Fig_250">Fig. 250</a>. They are veins of the body
walls, emptying cephalad of the liver, directly into the ducts of
Cuvier, and through them into the sinus venosus of the heart.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_262">Fig. 262</a> shows the arrangement of the venous system in a
typical selachian diagrammatically.</p>

<p><b>2. Amphibian. (<i>a</i>) Urodele.</b>&mdash;The following points are to be noted
in comparison with the preceding form:</p>

<p>1. The two ducts of Cuvier entering into the sinus venosus are
formed by the anterior cardinal and subclavian veins, which
latter, having appeared with the full development of an anterior
extremity, receives the posterior cardinal veins, representing the
mammalian azygos system.</p>

<p>2. The renal portal circulation persists. The caudal vein is,
however, no longer the only afferent vein of this system. With<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
the full development of a posterior extremity an iliac vein returns
the blood from the same and gives a large branch (afferent
to the portal renal system), while the trunk continues cephalad
as an anterior abdominal vein, corresponding to the lateral selachian
vein, emptying in the hepatic portal vein.</p>

<p>3. The efferent veins of the renal portal system no longer unite
to form the posterior cardinal, as in the Selachian, but empty into
a new median vessel, the inferior vena cava, or postcava, which
has replaced the distal segments of the posterior cardinal veins.</p>

<p>The postcava now carries the blood from the kidneys directly to
the heart. The original posterior cardinal veins still persist in
their proximal segments, as smaller trunks connecting the distal
part of the postcava with the ducts of Cuvier through the subclavian
veins. The ducts of Cuvier represent the precavæ (venæ
cavæ superiores) of mammalia and the postcardinals the mammalian
azygos veins.</p>

<p>4. The hepatic portal system differs in two respects from the
Selachian type.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The blood returned to the liver from the digestive tract by
the portal vein becomes mixed before entering the gland with the
blood returned from the posterior extremities and abdominal
walls by the abdominal vein.</p>

<p>This vein, paired below and continuous with the lateral of the
two branches into which the iliac vein divides, becomes united
into a single trunk above and empties into the portal vein.</p>

<p>The abdominal vein represents the lateral vein of the Selachian
and corresponds to the umbilical vein of the higher vertebrates.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The venæ hepaticæ revehentes do not empty directly into
the sinus venosus, but into the proximal portion of the postcava.</p>

<p>Hence the adult urodele venous system illustrates, in reference
to the mammalian development, these stages:</p>

<p>1. The umbilical (abdominal) vein has lost its direct connection
with the sinus venosus. The proximal segment, cephalad of the
liver, has disappeared, and its blood now passes directly into the
hepatic circulation by its union with the portal vein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span></p>

<p>(Cf. stage schema <a href="#Fig_251">Figs. 251</a> and <a href="#Fig_252">252</a>.)</p>

<p>2. The postcaval vein has made its appearance, largely replacing
the posterior cardinal veins, whose proximal segments became
converted into secondary vessels (azygos) uniting the system of
the postcava with that of the duct of Cuvier (mammalian præcava),
while their distal segments are transformed into the distal
portion of the postcava.</p>

<p>The postcava, therefore, is made up of two districts:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The proximal portion is a new vessel, developed in connection
with the hepatic venous system.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The distal portion is derived from the distal segments of the
original posterior cardinal veins.</p>

<p>The termination of the hepatic veins in the postcava corresponds
to the stage shown in schema <a href="#Fig_256">Fig. 256</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_263">Fig. 263</a> gives a schematic representation of the arrangement of
the venous system in a typical urodele amphibian (<i>Salamandra
maculosa</i>).</p>

<p>In Fig. 264 the dissected venous system of <i>Necturus maculatus</i>,
the mud puppy, is shown in an injected preparation.</p>

<p><b>(<i>b</i>) Anure.</b>&mdash;The venous system of <i>Rana esculenta</i> is shown in
<a href="#Fig_265">Fig. 265</a>. Comparison with venous system of <i>urodele</i>:</p>

<p>1. The abdominal vein, corresponding to the mammalian umbilical
vein, has assumed a greater importance in reference to the
hepatic circulation. It is a large trunk, continuous below with
the pelvic vein, terminating above in two branches, which enter
the liver as afferent veins, being joined just prior to the division
by the hepatic portal vein.</p>

<p>2. A small cardiac vein, coming from the heart, empties into
the angle of bifurcation of the abdominal vein.</p>

<p>Comparison with the mammalian development: the venous
system of this amphibian can be used to illustrate the mammalian
embryonal stage shown in schema <a href="#Fig_252">Fig. 252</a>, in which the abdominal
or umbilical vein has become the most important vessel
in the afferent hepatic venous system.</p>

<p>The communication existing by means of the cardiac vein between
the heart and the hepatic afferent system may suggest, but
<i>purely for illustrative purposes</i>, the direct connection of the umbilical
vein with the heart by the ductus venosus in the mammalian
embryo (cf. schema <a href="#Fig_250">Figs. 250</a>-<a href="#Fig_256">256</a>).</p>

<p><b>3. Reptile.</b>&mdash;In <i>Iguana</i> the renal portal system is well developed.
The caudal vein, returning the blood from the tail and the cavernous
tissue of the genital organs, continues for a short distance upon
the fused caudal end of the two kidneys (<a href="#Fig_269">Fig. 269</a>) and then
divides into two afferent renal veins which ascend on the
ventral surface of the glands, giving branches to the renal capillary
system. About the middle of the kidney each afferent
vein is joined by a large transverse branch from the abdominal
vein (<a href="#Fig_266">Fig. 266</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The renal efferent system begins by a number of inter-renal
anastomoses which unite along the mesal border of the right kidney
into a large ascending trunk, while the corresponding vessel
of the left side, starting from the same anastomosis, is considerably
smaller (Figs. 266 and 269). Each of these vessels also receives
blood from the testis, epididymis, vas deferens and adrenal
body in the male, and from the ovary and oviduct in the female.
They represent, in fact, the distal functional part of the right and
left embryonic postcardinal vein. Just caudad of the left testis the
vein of the left side crosses obliquely ventrad of the aorta and joins
the right vessel to form the trunk of the postcava, which enters,
immediately beyond the cephalic pole of the right testis, the
prolonged caval lobe of the liver (Figs. 266 and 269). Ascending
in the substance of this gland and receiving the afferent hepatic
veins (Fig. 268), the vena cava emerges from the cephalic surface
of the liver greatly enlarged and proceeds to the right auricle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span></p>

<p>The abdominal vein divides below into two branches which
pass caudad on each side of the bladder, receiving tributaries
from the same, to the lateral border of the kidneys (Figs. 266
and 269). Here the vessel is connected by the transverse branch
above described with the afferent renal portal system derived
from the caudal vein. At the same point it receives the sciatic
vein, the principal venous vessel of the posterior extremity.
Above, the main abdominal vein, resulting from the union of the
two branches referred to, ascends on the dorsal surface of the
ventral abdominal wall, receiving a few twigs from the ventral
mesogastrium within whose free caudal edge the vessel runs.
Just before reaching the liver the abdominal vein turns dorsad
on the caudal surface of the gland and joins the hepatic portal
vein (Figs. 268 and <a href="#Fig_275">275</a>). Several accessory veins, two or three
in number, belonging to the system of the abdominal vein, pass
above this point from the ventral body wall between the layers
of the ventral mesogastrium, to enter the liver separately on its
convex ventral surface, above the fusion of the main abdominal
vein with the portal vein. These additional branches on entering
the liver join the portal system, forming a set of ventral accessory
portal veins.</p>

<p>The hepatic portal vein derives its principal tributaries from
the splenic, gastric, pancreatic and intestinal veins. One or two
additional branches (accessory vertebral portal veins), as above
stated, connect the system of the segmental and vertebral veins
with the portal circulation, entering the liver separately. In like
manner one or two gastric veins (accessory gastric portal veins)
enter the dorsal aspect of the liver separately, passing from
the stomach to the gland between the layers of the gastro-hepatic
omentum (<a href="#Fig_275">Fig. 275</a>).</p>

<p>Compared with the development of the mammalian type, the
venous system of Iguana serves to illustrate the stage in the history
of the umbilical vein (represented by the abdominal vein of
the reptile) in which the connection of the vessel with the portal
vein has been formed and transmits the greater part of the blood<span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
returned by the umbilical vein to the liver, while the proximal
segment above this point, originally continued into the sinus
venosus, has begun to disappear, being, however, still represented
by the vessels which, as accessory ventral portal veins, pass in the
ventral mesogastrium, from the body wall to the liver.</p>

<p>It will be noted that all the hepatic portal blood, whether conducted
by the main portal and abdominal vein, or by the accessory
portal branches, traverses the capillary circulation of the
liver before entering the postcava.</p>

<p>The vertebral and segmental venous system, representing the
azygos veins of the mammalia, is very rudimentary (<a href="#Fig_266">Figs. 266</a>
and <a href="#Fig_267">267</a>). The distal portions of the postcardinal veins form the
efferent renal branches and the ascending trunks of the postcava.</p>

<p>The next segment of the vertebral veins appears as a trunk on
the right side which enters the portal circulation. A second vein
higher up is connected with both the gastric portal system and with
the longitudinal chain of the vertebral veins. Finally a proximal
venous branch on each side of the vertebral column, representing
the upper portion of the postcardinal veins, receives the proximal
segmental veins and empties into the subclavian vein (<a href="#Fig_267">Fig. 267</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><b>4. Bird.</b>&mdash;The characteristic change in the venous system of
the bird, as compared with that of the amphibian and reptile, is
found in the nearly complete abolition of the renal portal system.
The caudal vein bifurcates, sending on each side a large trunk,
which receives the pelvic (int. iliac) veins, to the kidney (renal
afferent portal vein), but only a few small branches enter the substance
of the gland (Fig. 270, afferent renal V). The main vessel
continues cephalad through the kidney and, after receiving
the vein from the posterior extremity (femoral), unites as common
iliac vein with the vessel of the opposite side to form the postcava.
This vessel traverses the liver, receiving the hepatic afferent
veins of the portal system. The portal vein is formed by
tributaries from the intestinal canal, pancreas and spleen, and is
also joined by a large coccygeo-mesenteric vein, which is given
off at the point of bifurcation of the caudal vein and receives<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
tributaries from the lower part of the alimentary canal. The
abdominal vein of amphibians and reptiles is represented probably
by the epigastric vein, which returns the blood from the
omental mass of fat to the hepatic veins.</p>

<p>Compared with the mammal on the one hand, and with the
lower types on the other, the venous circulation of the bird illustrates
the following points:</p>

<p>1. Extensive reduction of the renal portal system and direct
formation of postcava by the iliac veins, foreshadowing the condition
found in the mammal.</p>

<p>2. Complete separation of the portal and systemic venous circulation
in the adult. Disappearance of the ventral abdominal
vein as a vessel of the body wall.</p>

<p class="center"><b>II. THE VENTRAL MESOGASTRIUM.</b></p>

<p>This membrane has been heretofore mentioned on several occasions.
It now remains for us to carefully consider its arrangement
in detail, both as regards the peritoneal relations of the liver
and in reference to its influence on the abdominal space as a
whole. We can best accomplish this purpose by considering the
membrane in the first place in a purely schematic manner. In
contradistinction to the primitive common dorsal mesentery,
which extends the entire length of the alimentary tube, the ventral
mesentery, or properly the ventral mesogastrium, is confined
to the stomach and proximal portion of the duodenum. We can
represent the membrane as extending between the ventral abdominal
wall and the ventral border (later the lesser curvature)
of the stomach and of the hepatic angle of the duodenum.
Cephalad it is connected with the embryonic septum transversum
(future diaphragm). Caudad its two layers pass into each other
in a free concave edge, including between them the umbilical
vein (free edge of falciform ligament of adult). Consequently a
schematic profile or lateral view of the membrane and its attachments
in the earlier stages would appear as represented in <a href="#Fig_273">Fig.
273</a>, while the arrangement in transection would be as shown in
<a href="#Fig_274">Fig. 274</a>. It will be observed that the separation of the cephalic
portion of the abdominal cavity into symmetrical right and left
halves, previously indicated in discussing the primitive stomach
and the dorsal mesogastrium, is actually completed by the ventral
mesogastrium. This complete separation of the lateral
halves of the c&oelig;lom cavity ceases at the point where the ventral
mesogastrium terminates in the free concave edge carrying the
umbilical vein. Hence caudad of this falciform edge the two
halves of the cavity communicate freely with each other ventrad
of the intestine and dorsal mesentery.</p>

<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_274"></a>Fig. 274.</span>&mdash;Schematic transection of abdomen in region of ventral mesogastrium.
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span></p>
<p>This difference in the extent of the mesogastria is perhaps best
understood by reference to their relation to the first portion of the
duodenum. We have seen that the duodenum in the early stages
is attached dorsally by a portion of the common dorsal mesentery,
which, after differentiation of the intestinal tract, immediately
follows the dorsal mesogastrium proper, forming the mesoduodenum
(<a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>). The proximal portion of the duodenum
(hepatic angle) is still included within the fold of the ventral
mesogastrium which membrane terminates immediately beyond
this point in the free edge surrounding the umbilical vein
(subsequent round ligament) (<a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>). The remainder of
the duodenum is devoid of any ventral attachment, being only
connected to the dorsal body wall by the mesoduodenum (<a href="#Fig_197">Fig.
197</a>).</p>

<p>Subsequently, after the fourth month, while the right surface
of the mesoduodenum and descending duodenum adhere to the
parietal peritoneum, the peritoneal investment of the first portion
or hepatic angle remains free. This peritoneal covering of
the proximal duodenal segment is situated at the point where the
caudal end of the ventral mesogastrium, after surrounding the
first portion of the duodenum, becomes continuous with the dorsal
mesentery forming the mesoduodenum. Obliteration of the
latter membrane by adhesion to the parietal peritoneum leaves
the first portion of the duodenum invested on both surfaces by
the <i>lesser omentum</i>, derived from the ventral mesogastrium. The
ventral surface of the gut is covered by the ventral layer, the
dorsal surface by the dorsal layer of the lesser omentum. These
two layers become continuous around the right free edge of the
lesser omentum (hepato-duodenal ligament) forming the ventral
boundary of the foramen of Winslow (cf. infra, <a href="#Page_177">p.&nbsp;177</a>).</p>

<p>Returning to the schematic consideration of the ventral mesogastrium
above outlined (Figs. 273 and 274) we have to note the
first important change in the arrangement depending upon the
development of the liver. This organ, growing, as we have seen,
from the duodenum, extends between the two layers of the ven<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>tral
mesogastrium, receiving a serous investment from the
same. At an early period the liver, developing thus between
the mesogastric layers, reaches the septum transversum and
becomes closely connected with it, laying the foundation for
the subsequent extensive attachment of the gland to the diaphragm.</p>

<p>Extending caudad the liver grows beyond the caudal free edge
of the ventral mesogastrium on each side, carrying the serosa with
it. Consequently the ventral margin of the liver becomes indented
at this point; the umbilical vein and subsequently its
fibrous remnant, the round ligament, are imbedded in a notch
and fissure (umbilical notch and fissure) continued from the ventral
margin dorsad along the caudal surface of the liver (<a href="#Fig_259">Fig.
259</a>).</p>

<p>This growth of the liver has now effected a division of the primitive
ventral mesogastrium into two segments:</p>

<p>1. Ventral portion, between diaphragm and liver, forms the
broad falciform or suspensory ligament of the liver.</p>

<p>2. The dorsal portion, between liver and stomach, forms the
lesser or gastro-hepatic omentum.</p>

<p>The caudal free edge of the ventral mesogastrium extends
between the umbilicus and the caudal surface of the liver, carrying
the umbilical vein between its layers. The growth of the liver
serves to bury this free edge and the contained vein in a fissure on
the caudal surface of the liver. The same obtains in the case of
the ductus venosus continued from the umbilical vein (umbilical
fissure and fissure of ductus venosus of adult liver). Consequently
the original continuity of the broad ligament and lesser
omentum, as parts of the primitive ventral mesogastrium, is not
readily seen in the adult.</p>

<p>The broad ligament extends across the convex cephalic surface
of the liver uniting it to the ventral abdominal wall and diaphragm,
while its free falciform edge apparently stops at the umbilical
notch in the ventral border of the organ. Actually, however,
the obliterated vein is surrounded in the bottom of the<span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>
fissure, by a peritoneal fold which effects the junction between
broad ligament and lesser omentum.</p>

<p>We will see later in what way the permanent adult arrangement
of the lesser omentum is brought about. For the present
we can state, on the hand of the schematic <a href="#Fig_273">Fig. 273</a>, that the free
caudal edge of the falciform ligament containing the umbilical
vein, and the free edge of the gastro-hepatic omentum form together
originally the caudal free edge of the ventral mesogastrium, which
membrane becomes separated, by the growth of the liver, into
suspensory or broad ligament and lesser or gastro-hepatic
omentum.</p>

Museum, No. 1313.)
</div>

<p>This primitive disposition of the ventral mesogastrium and the
viscera connected with the same, is well shown in some of the
lower vertebrates in whom the development never proceeds beyond
the early mammalian stages. Fig. 275 shows in profile
view from the right side the situs viscerum and peritoneum in
<i>Iguana tuberculata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The two dorsal aortic roots are seen to unite
to form the main aorta, which descends between the layers of
the dorsal mesentery, sending branches to the dorsal margin of
&oelig;sophagus and stomach. From the opposite border of the stomach
the ventral mesogastrium is derived. Its dorsal segment (gastro-hepatic
omentum) connects liver and stomach, carrying between
its layers the portal vessels, hepatic artery and biliary duct. The
ventral segment of the membrane, forming the suspensory or broad
ligament, extends between abdominal wall and ventral surface of
the liver. Caudad, the lesser omentum and the suspensory ligament
are seen to have a common concave falciform edge.</p>

<p>The ventral abdominal vein ascends between the layers of the
suspensory ligament and near the liver becomes connected by a
<span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>large branch with the portal vein. A few smaller branches are
seen passing from the abdominal wall beyond this point. In this
reptile, therefore, the permanent vascular arrangement corresponds
to an early human embryonic stage.</p>

<p>The reptilian ventral abdominal vein is the homologue of the
umbilical vein of the placentalia. The large branch passing to
the portal vein represents the connection established in the human
embryo between the umbilical and portal veins. The small
branches, continuing cephalad between the mesogastric layers,
represent the temporary proximal remnants which in the human
embryo the umbilical veins form in connection with abdominal
walls. The permanent adult arrangement of this part of the
vascular system in this animal corresponds therefore to one of
the stages of development in the human embryo, as previously
indicated (cf. <a href="#Page_149">p.&nbsp;149</a>; <a href="#Fig_251">Figs. 251</a> and <a href="#Fig_252">252</a>).</p>


<p class="center"><b>PERITONEAL RELATIONS OF LIVER.</b></p>

<p>It is well to begin the study of the peritoneal connections of the
liver with the consideration of the embryonic stage shown in <a href="#Fig_273">Fig.
273</a> schematically.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/fig276.jpg" width="550" height="255" alt="" />
<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_276"></a>Fig. 276.</span>&mdash;Schematic view of embryonic liver detached from its connections, seen from
behind, with lines of peritoneal reflection.
</div>

<p>If we imagine this embryonic liver detached from its connections
in such a manner as to leave the divided peritoneal layers
of the ventral mesogastrium as long as possible, and if we regard
the preparation from behind, the appearance of the parts could
be represented in Fig. 276.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>It will of course be seen that the area of direct adhesion to
the diaphragm, extending transversely, would separate the lesser
omentum from the suspensory ligament.</p>

<p>As is seen in the transection (<a href="#Fig_274">Fig. 274</a>), the right and left layers
of the suspensory ligament, at its attachment to the liver, turn
into the visceral peritoneum investing the organ on its ventral
and cephalic surfaces. Continuing around the borders of the
<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>liver this visceral peritoneum then invests in like manner the
dorsal or caudal surface directed toward the stomach, until, at the
region of the future portal or transverse fissure, this visceral peritoneum
becomes in turn continuous with the two layers of the
lesser or gastro-hepatic omentum. Consequently in the embryonic
detached liver the lines of peritoneal reflection would be
nearly cruciform, the vertical limb of the cross being formed on
the cephalic surface by the two layers of the suspensory ligament,
while on the caudal surface it is formed by the layers of the lesser
omentum. The horizontal arm of the cross is formed by the
upper and lower limits of the area of diaphragmatic attachment,
along which the parietal diaphragmatic peritoneum turns
into the visceral hepatic investment (forming the two layers of the
primitive coronary ligament). In the liver shown thus schematically
from behind we would overlook the dorsal and adjoining
portions of the cephalic and caudal surfaces of the adult
human liver.</p>

<p>The primitive biliary duct, portal vein and hepatic artery reach
the liver between the layers of the lesser omentum. The venæ
revehentes (hepatic veins) reach the sinus venosus at the attachment
of the liver to the septum transversum (primitive diaphragm).</p>

<p>The first important change, resulting in a rearrangement of
these peritoneal layers, is produced by the connection of the
umbilical with the rudimentary portal vein.</p>

<p>This junction occupies a relatively wide area on the caudal
surface of the liver, and the layers of the lesser omentum are
separated somewhat at this point to accommodate the enlarging
vascular structures between them. More especially is this the
case with the right leaf of the primitive gastro-hepatic omentum.
A species of lateral diverticulum is formed by this leaf so as to
include the umbilical vein at its junction with the portal.
The membrane in the region of this diverticulum turns its surfaces
dorsad and ventrad, and its free edge toward the right (Fig. 277).
With the gradual increase in the size of the vessels, and with the<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
transverse position which the rotation of the stomach imparts to
the opposite border of the lesser omentum attached to the lesser
curvature, this transversely disposed portion gradually exceeds in
length and size the part of the original omentum enclosing the
umbilical vein. This vessel and the investing peritoneum become
lodged in a sagittal depression on the caudal surface of the
liver (rudimentary umbilical fissure), while the transverse portion,
developed as indicated, surrounds the structures connected with
the liver at the future transverse or portal fissure.</p>

<p>Schematically this rearrangement of the hepatic peritoneal lines
of reflection can be shown in Fig. 278.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in this way a small part of the caudal
surface of the right lobe has become partially marked off from the
remainder as a rudimentary Spigelian lobe, bounded ventrally by
the transverse fissure and lesser omentum attached to the same;
to the left by the two layers of the lesser omentum containing
the ductus venosus; while the limit cephalad is afforded by the
reflection of peritoneum from liver to diaphragm, forming part of
caudal layer of right coronary ligament. To the right this rudimentary
Spigelian surface is directly continuous with the rest of
the dorsal and caudal surface of the right lobe (Fig. 277).
Finally a definite right limit is given to the Spigelian lobe by the
increasing size of the postcava and its closer connection with the
liver. This vessel now assumes the position of the main venous
trunk entering the heart from below.</p>

<p>This inclusion of the vena cava in the fissure or fossa of that
name on the dorsal surface of the liver affords, so to speak, the
vertical measure of the non-peritoneal area of the liver attached
directly to the diaphragm. As the vein develops the interval
between the two layers of the right coronary ligament increases,
producing the well-known large non-peritoneal area on the dorsal
surface of the adult liver, which is directly attached to the
diaphragm.</p>

<p>Immediately to the left of the vena cava, however, the original
condition persists. The area of direct diaphragmatic attachment<span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
is narrow and consequently the two layers of the coronary ligament
are close together at this point.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>In this way a species of recess (Spigelian recess or hepatic
antrum of lesser sac) is formed. A portion of the dorsal liver
surface lying just to the left of the vena cava, between it and the
ductus venosus, remains invested by peritoneum which is reflected
from the boundaries of this space to the diaphragm. This forms
the Spigelian lobe (Fig. 278).</p>

<p>The lobe is bounded to the right by the postcava, to the left
by the reflection of the lesser omentum to the stomach along the
fissure for the ductus venosus; cephalad the boundary is formed
by the reflection of the caudal layer of the coronary ligament to
the diaphragm.</p>

<p>The caudal boundary is afforded by the transverse position
which the lesser omentum has assumed in the region of the transverse
or portal fissure.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the original continuity of the Spigelian
lobe with the caudal surface of the right lobe is maintained by
the narrow bridge of liver tissue connecting the caudal right angle
of the rectangular Spigelian lobe with the right lobe. This narrow
isthmus, situated between vena cava dorsad and the free right
edge of lesser omentum ventrad, forms the so-called <i>caudate lobe</i>.</p>

<p>Fig. 279 shows a human f&oelig;tal liver at the end of the eighth
month in the view from below and behind. The original continuity
of the layers of the lesser omentum, attached along the
fissure for the ductus venosus, with the fold of the falciform ligament
occupying the umbilical fissure can still be made out for a
short distance beyond the left extremity of the transverse fissure.
The section of the lesser omentum which occupies the transverse
<span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>fissure and, including the portal vein, hepatic artery and duct
between its layers, terminates in the free right margin, is evidently
derived by a lateral extension from the right layer of the primitive
sagittal lesser omentum, whose original direction is preserved
along the fissure of the ductus venosus.</p>

<p>In Fig. 280 the lines of peritoneal reflection on the cephalic,
dorsal and caudal surfaces of a human f&oelig;tal liver at term are
shown.</p>

<p>We can now proceed to trace the reflection of the peritoneum
from the liver to adjacent structures.</p>

<p>Begin with the caudal layer of the coronary ligament on the
extreme right, where fusion with the corresponding cephalic
layer produces the right triangular ligament. The caudal layer
of the coronary ligament proceeds from right to left along the
caudal margin of the non-peritoneal dorsal diaphragmatic surface
of right lobe, being reflected along this line from the liver to the
adjacent portions of the diaphragm and ventral surface of right
kidney and suprarenal capsule (hepato-renal ligament). A small
cephalic part of ventral surface of right suprarenal capsule lies
above this line of reflection, is hence non-peritoneal and firmly
connected with the liver just to the left of entrance of vena
cava into the caval fissure. Continuing, the caudal layer of the
coronary ligament crosses the ventral surface of the vena cava
and turns, immediately to the left of the vein, at a right angle,
ascending to form the left boundary of the Spigelian recess, being
reflected along this line from the left margin of the caval fissure
to the pillars of the diaphragm. Arrived at the opening of the
central tendon permitting passage of vena cava into pericardium,
and at the level of the entrance of the left hepatic vein into the
cava, the peritoneum turns again at a right angle and runs from
right to left, forming the cephalic limit of the Spigelian recess.
Turning caudad along the fissure for the ductus venosus, as right
leaf of that portion of the lesser omentum which is attached to this
fissure and has preserved its sagittal position, the peritoneal line
of reflection reaches the left extremity of the portal or transverse<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>
fissure. It now turns to the right following the fissure as the
dorsal layer of the transverse segment of the lesser omentum, and
becomes continuous, with the formation of a free right edge, with
the ventral layer of the same membrane, passing from right to
left, the two layers including between them the structures entering
and leaving the liver at the transverse fissure (portal vein,
hepatic artery, duct). Arriving at the left extremity of the transverse
fissure the ventral layer of the transverse segment of the
lesser omentum&mdash;as we practically trace it in the adult as a free
membrane&mdash;turns directly into the left leaf of the sagittal segment
attached along the fissure for the ductus venosus, and becomes
continuous along the dorsal border of the left lobe with the
caudal layer of the left coronary ligament. This direct continuity,
as just stated, exists practically in the adult. From the development
of the membrane, however, it will be seen that the ventral
layer of the transverse lesser omentum, at the left extremity of
the portal fissure, becomes continuous with the right layer of the
primitive mesogastrium enclosing the umbilical vein. After surrounding
this vein it is continued into the left leaf of the same
membrane, which in turn passes into the left layer of the portion
attached along the fissure for the ductus venosus.</p>

<p>This original connection can at times be traced very clearly in
young specimens (<a href="#Fig_279">Fig. 279</a>), and occasionally is also still evident
in the adult liver.</p>

<p>Usually, however, the round ligament of the adult and its
investing peritoneum is buried so deeply in the umbilical fissure,
or even bridged over in part by liver tissue, that the connection
is not evident. The ventral layer of the transverse omentum then
appears directly continuous with the left layer of the sagittal
omentum attached along the fissure for the ductus venosus.</p>

<p>We can sum up the facts just considered as follows:</p>

<p>1. The rotation of the stomach from the sagittal into the transverse
position, and the development of the umbilical and portal
veins, rearrange the original sagittal plane of the lesser omentum,
dividing it into two districts:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Cephalic portion, remaining in the original sagittal plane,
follows the fissure for the ductus venosus. With the incorporation
of the Spigelian lobe in the adult dorsal or &ldquo;posterior&rdquo; surface
of the liver, this segment of the omentum assumes a vertical
direction, forming the left boundary of the Spigelian recess, being
reflected from the fissure for the ductus venosus to the abdominal
portion of the &oelig;sophagus and the part of the lesser curvature of
stomach adjacent to the cardia.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Distal caudal portion of the lesser omentum is twisted laterally
and turned to the right by the change in the position of the
stomach and the development of the structures connected with
the liver at the transverse fissure. It is reflected from this fissure
to the distal part of the lesser curvature and to the first portion
of the duodenum. This transverse segment of the lesser omentum
is a secondary derivative from the right leaf of the primitive
membrane, produced by the enlarged area for entrance of umbilical
and portal veins at the transverse fissure. It lies ventrad of
caudal border of Spigelian lobe.</p>

<p>2. The distal segment of the original omentum containing the
umbilical vein (round ligament), continues imbedded in the umbilical
fissure, to the ventral margin of the liver, where it joins the
layers of the suspensory ligament passing over the cephalic surface.</p>

<p>3. The adult lesser omentum at the transverse fissure may be
regarded as a diverticulum of the right leaf of the primitive
embryonal sagittal omentum.</p>

<p>With the reduction of the umbilical vein after birth to form
the round ligament this structure becomes deeply buried in the
umbilical fissure. The ventral and dorsal layers of the lesser
omentum at the transverse fissure thus become continuous with
respectively the left and right layers of the second segment of the
omentum which ascends vertically along the fissure for the ductus
venosus.</p>

<p>4. The cephalic layer of the coronary ligament (<a href="#Fig_280">Fig. 280</a>) remains
practically in the embryonic condition. The adult convex
cephalic surface of the liver is traversed in the sagittal direction<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
by the suspensory ligament which connects it with the abdominal
surface of the diaphragm, and thus effects the division into right
and left lobes on the convex surface. Arrived at the dorsal
border of this surface (junction of &ldquo;superior&rdquo; and &ldquo;posterior&rdquo;
surfaces) the right and left leaves of the falciform ligament turn
at right angles into the cephalic layer of the right and left coronary
ligament, which at each extremity meet the right and left
caudal layers to form the triangular ligaments. It will thus be
seen that the apparent irregularity in the relative arrangement of
the s. c. &ldquo;upper&rdquo; and &ldquo;lower&rdquo; layers of the coronary ligaments,
produced by the Spigelian recess, is only a difference in the interval
between the two layers, caused by the vertical extent of the
non-peritoneal direct diaphragmatic attachment of the right lobe
to the right of the vena cava.</p>

<p>Compared with the human liver it will be noted that the area
of diaphragmatic adhesion is much less developed. The dorsal
surface of the right lobe to the right of the postcava is peritoneal,
there being no extension laterad of the right coronary and
triangular ligaments. The postcava enters the liver in a special
prolongation of the liver substance (caval lobe).</p>

<p>The boundaries of the Spigelian recess and the lines of attachment
of the gastro-hepatic omentum correspond to the human
arrangement.</p>


<p class="center"><b>RELATION OF THE HEPATIC PERITONEUM TO THE
&ldquo;LESSER SAC.&rdquo;</b></p>

<p><i>Foramen of Winslow.</i>&mdash;We have previously seen that the rotation
of the stomach and the further growth of the dorsal mesogastrium
lead, in the first instance, to the formation of the &ldquo;lesser peritoneal
cavity.&rdquo; This cavity is in fact primarily the retrogastric space
created by the transverse position of the stomach, augmented by<span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
the cavity of the omental bursa developed from the dorsal mesogastrium.</p>

<p>We have now to consider the additional boundaries of this
space contributed by the peritoneal connection of the lesser
curvature with the liver.</p>

</div>

<p>The lesser omentum follows, of course, along its gastric attachment
to the lesser curvature the general direction of the stomach,
passing from the cardia transversely downwards and to the right.
We distinguish the two layers of the adult membrane as ventral
and dorsal, which meet in the free right edge and include between
them the main structures entering and leaving the liver at the
transverse fissure, viz.: the portal vein, hepatic artery and bile-duct.</p>

<p>The lesser omentum therefore prolongs the plane of the stomach
cephalad towards the liver and thus forms the continuation of the
ventral boundary of the lesser peritoneal sac. We can now consider
the line of its hepatic attachment in the light of the facts
previously adduced, and combine the same with the line of gastric
attachment to the lesser curvature. Fig. 282 shows the f&oelig;tal
liver and stomach in their relative position in the dorsal view,
and Fig. 283 gives the lines of the peritoneal reflections. The
vertical segment of the omentum, occupying the fissure for the
ductus venosus, passes to the cardiac part of the lesser curvature,
its ventral layer covering the ventral and left side of the &oelig;sophagus,
while its dorsal layer passes to the dorsal and right side of
the &oelig;sophagus at its entrance into the stomach. The transverse
segment of the omentum, attached on the liver to the portal or
transverse fissure, accedes to the pyloric part of the lesser curvature.
Of course the ventral and dorsal layers of the omentum are
continuous with the serous visceral investment of the ventral and
dorsal surfaces of the stomach.</p>

<p>Fig. 284 shows this right-angled course of the lesser omentum
at the hepatic line of attachment in a preparation of the abdominal
viscera hardened in situ, with the segment of the stomach
between the cardiac and pyloric orifices removed. The arrow is
passed behind the right free edge of the lesser omentum. This<span class="pagenum" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>
portion of the membrane is still intact, not having been disturbed
by the removal of the body of the stomach, and includes between
its layers the structures connected with the liver at the transverse
fissure (duct, hepatic artery and portal vein). The lesser omentum
is seen to be attached to the liver along the transverse fissure
(Fig. 284, <i>A</i>) and along the fissure for the ductus venosus (Fig.
284, <i>B</i>), constituting the transverse and vertical segments above
referred to, which pass into each other at the angle of junction
between the transverse fissure (left end) and the fissure for the
ductus venosus (Fig. 284, <i>C</i>). The caudal and left border of the
Spigelian lobe is exposed by the division of the omentum, and the
extent of the Spigelian or hepatic recess of the lesser peritoneal
sac is shown. Fig. 285 shows the liver, stomach and lesser omentum
of a Macaque monkey hardened in situ, and demonstrates
still more conclusively that the uniform curve of the omentum
along the lesser curvature of the stomach becomes a broken line
at the hepatic attachment, the angle being placed at the left end
of the transverse fissure at the point where the same encounters
the fissure for the ductus venosus.</p>

<p>In Fig. 286 finally the hardened abdominal viscera of an adult
human subject are shown in the ventral view with the lesser omentum
incised. The cut through the lesser omentum exposes the
hepatic recess of the lesser peritoneal cavity immediately to the
left of the foramen of Winslow. Toward the right free margin of
the omentum the divided portal vein, hepatic artery and duct are
seen between the layers of the omentum imbedded in the pancreas
and coursing behind the first portion of the duodenum on
their way to the transverse fissure.</p>

<p>To the left of these structures the omental tuberosity of the
pancreas projects above the level of the lesser curvature under
cover of the secondary parietal peritoneum forming the dorsal
wall of the lesser sac, while the lower edge of the Spigelian lobe
appears in the upper angle of the incision.</p>

<p>If we remember that the liver is itself welded to the diaphragm
between the layers of the coronary ligament (<a href="#Fig_280">Fig. 280</a>), it will become <span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>apparent that the serous surface of the Spigelian lobe forms
part of the ventral wall of a peritoneal recess situated behind the
lesser omentum, between this membrane and the diaphragm.
Access to this recess, without the division of peritoneal layers, can
only be obtained by passing from right to left, along the caudate
lobe, between the vena cava behind, covered by parietal peritoneum,
and the free right edge of the lesser omentum in front.
(In the reverse direction of the arrow shown in <a href="#Fig_284">Fig. 284</a>.) This
hepatic or Spigelian recess of the lesser peritoneal cavity has categorically
the following boundaries (<a href="#Fig_282">Figs. 282</a> and <a href="#Fig_283">283</a>):</p>

<p>Dorsal: Parietal peritoneum, reflected along the line <span class="lowercase smcap">CD</span>, from
the caudal layer of the coronary ligament to the diaphragm.</p>

<p>Ventral: Visceral peritoneum investing the Spigelian lobe and
the gastro-hepatic omentum.</p>

<p>Right: Reflection of peritoneum along the line <span class="lowercase smcap">DE</span> (caval fissure)
to become the parietal peritoneum covering the diaphragm.</p>

<p>Left: Right layer of lesser omentum, reflected along the fissure
for the ductus venosus (<span class="lowercase smcap">CB</span>) to the cardiac portion of the lesser
curvature, continuous with the dorsal layer of the lesser omentum
reflected from the transverse fissure to the pyloric segment of
the lesser curvature (<span class="lowercase smcap">AB</span>).</p>

<p>We will presently see that certain relations of the vessels connected
with the liver at the transverse fissure and of the duodenum
prevent the finger, when passed from right to left behind
the free right edge of the lesser omentum and along the caudate
lobe of the liver, from proceeding downward at this point. A
narrow channel of communication is thus formed between the
Spigelian recess and rest of the lesser sac on the one hand, and the
general greater peritoneal cavity on the other. This channel is
the so-called foramen of Winslow.</p>

<p>Having once passed this narrow space the finger will be in
the Spigelian recess and can palpate its boundaries. Further
progress cephalad and to the right is barred by the diaphragmatic
adhesions of the liver just detailed. But in the direction downward
behind the lesser omentum and along the dorsal surface of<span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>
the stomach, as well as to the left toward the spleen the excursion
is limited only by the length of the examining finger.</p>

<p>After opening the abdominal cavity of the human adult, elevating
the liver and depressing the stomach, the hepatic attachment
of the lesser omentum can be traced as already described. It will
then be observed that the gastric attachment of the membrane
lies in one plane following the lesser curvature while the hepatic
attachment forms a broken line, with the angle situated at the
left extremity of the transverse fissure. The vertical segment of
the hepatic attachment, occupying the fissure for the ductus
venosus, turns at this angle into the transverse segment which
follows the transverse fissure to its right extremity where the two
layers pass into each other around the right free omental margin
(hepato-duodenal ligament). Consequently we overlook, in an
abdominal cavity thus exposed, the entire caudal surface of the
liver, including the caudal surfaces of right, left, and quadrate
lobes. The junction of right and caudate lobes can be seen
between vena cava and right edge of the omentum, or rather, it
can be felt at this point. But the Spigelian lobe, turning its surface
dorsad against the parietal peritoneum covering the diaphragm,
forms part of the &ldquo;posterior&rdquo; liver surface and is not
visible, although&mdash;as just stated, it can be palpated by passing
the finger through the foramen of Winslow. The Spigelian lobe
cannot be overlooked in its entire extent until the liver is removed
from the body and regarded from behind. The caudal edge (continuation
of its right angle into the caudate lobe and papillary
tubercle) can be seen by tearing through the layers of the lesser
omentum and lifting the liver up forcibly (Fig. 286).</p>

<p><b>Caudal Boundary of Foramen of Winslow.</b>&mdash;We have above referred
to the fact that the finger introduced through the foramen
of Winslow meets in this canal with resistance if an attempt is
made to pass downwards. After passing this constricting point
the free excursion into the Spigelian recess and behind the omentum
and stomach and toward the spleen can be performed.</p>

<p>In considering the elements which produce this narrowing of<span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>
the communication between the two peritoneal sacs at the foramen
of Winslow we have to deal with two factors, one primary and
constant, the other secondary and inconstant.</p>

<p>1. The first of these is afforded by the arrangement of the
arterial vessel supplying the liver. The hepatic artery is a
branch of the c&oelig;liac axis, furnishing arterial blood to the liver
tissues and supplying, in addition, branches to the stomach, duodenum
and pancreas.</p>

<p>This vessel is, of course, placed primarily, like all other arterial
branches supplying the alimentary tract, between the layers of
the primitive dorsal mesentery. Originally the vessel supplies
the distal (pyloric) portion of the stomach along its dorsal attached
border (subsequently the greater curvature) corresponding
to the adult gastro-epiploica dextra of the hepatic (gastro-duodenalis).</p>

<p>It likewise gives branches to the adjacent pyloric portion of the
duodenum and the pancreas, as that gland develops from the intestine,
corresponding to the adult superior pancreatico-duodenal
branch, and to the ventral border (lesser curvature) of stomach,
corresponding to the adult pyloric branch of the hepatic.</p>

<p>With the development of the liver from the duodenum arterial
branches derived from this primitive gastro-duodenal vessel pass
to the sprouting hepatic cylinders by continuing around the duodenum,
beneath its serous investment, to reach the interval between
the two layers of the ventral mesogastrium, in which the
liver develops, near the free margin of this membrane.</p>

<p>After the rotation, which turns the right side of the stomach,
duodenum and mesoduodenum dorsad, the branch which passes
over the dorsal surface of the duodenum to reach the liver becomes
more favorably situated and develops into the main hepatic
artery which reaches the liver at the transverse fissure between
the folds of the lesser omentum. The original right side of the
duodenum, now turned dorsad, adheres to the parietal peritoneum.
The hepatic artery which reached the liver by passing
over this surface of the duodenum, beneath its visceral serous cover<span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>ing,
becomes imbedded in connective tissue by the adhesion of the
visceral duodenal and the primitive parietal peritoneum. Hence
in the adult the hepatic artery courses imbedded in the connective
tissue which binds the duodenum to the abdominal background
to reach the interval between the two omental layers which carry
it to the transverse fissure.</p>

<p>The hepatic artery, therefore, derived from one of the primitive
intestinal branches (gastro-duodenal) is, notwithstanding its
hidden position in the adult, originally situated between the layers
of the free primitive dorsal mesogastrium.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 390px;">
<img src="images/fig287.jpg" width="390" height="374" alt="" />
<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_287"></a>Fig. 287.</span>&mdash;Primitive dorsal and ventral mesogastrium with course of hepatic
artery.
</div>

<p>It now becomes necessary to regard the development of the
great omentum from the primitive dorsal mesogastrium in relation
to this course of the hepatic artery. We have seen that
the great omentum and the cavity of the omental bursa is produced
by the extension of the dorsal mesogastrium to the left and
caudad, subsequent to the rotation of the stomach. The splenic
artery and the left gastro-epiploic branch pass from the c&oelig;liac
axis to the left between the layers of the mesogastrium, as previously
seen (<a href="#Fig_291">Figs. 291</a> and <a href="#Fig_292">292</a>).</p>

<p>The hepatic artery, however, is so to speak placed on the border
line between the portion of the primitive mesentery which, as
dorsal mesogastrium, is to turn to the left and caudad to form the
great omentum, and the portion which, as mesoduodenum, turns
to the right and passes to the duodenal loop (Fig. 287).</p>

<p>In the further course of development the dorsal mesogastrium
grows more and more, forming the omental bag, while the mesoduodenum
on the other hand becomes anchored early and obliterated
as a free membrane by adhesion of its original right layer
to the primitive parietal peritoneum. The hepatic artery runs on
the line dividing these two different mesenteric segments. We can
imagine, so to speak, that the redundant growth of the omentum
to the left and caudad, takes place over the hepatic artery as a
resistant support (Figs. 288 and 289). Cephalad of the hepatic
artery is the developing omentum, caudad of the vessel the mesoduodenum.
The artery follows the cephalic limit of the meso<span class="pagenum" title="181"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span>duodenum
and becomes, as stated, adherent to the abdominal
background in the segment between its origin from the c&oelig;liac
axis and the point where, after having crossed the dorsal surface
of the duodenum, it enters the right edge of the lesser omentum
on its way to the liver.</p>

<p><b>Pancreatico-gastric Folds.</b>&mdash;If we open the lesser peritoneal cavity
by dividing the gastro-hepatic omentum and look into the background
of the retro-omental space, we will see a fold of the
secondary lining parietal peritoneum (derived from the mesogastrium),
which can be traced from the cephalic border of the pancreas
to the pyloric extremity of the stomach. This fold carries
the hepatic artery to the lesser omentum behind the first portion
of the duodenum, and is called the right or main pancreatico-gastric
fold. A similar fold, further to the left, carries in a like
manner the coronary artery of the stomach to the cardiac end of
the lesser curvature. This fold forms the left or secondary pancreatico-gastric
fold. Between the two folds the caudal margin
of the Spigelian lobe projects into the lesser cavity.</p>

<p>The appearance of the two pancreatico-gastric folds in the
adult human subject is well seen in <a href="#Fig_284">Fig. 284</a>.</p>

<p>Fig. 290 shows the abdominal cavity of <i>Nasua rufa</i>, with great
omentum divided to bring into view the vessels passing from
c&oelig;liac axis to liver and stomach and elevating the retrogastric
parietal peritoneum to produce the pancreatico-gastric folds.</p>

<p>(The course of the hepatic artery from c&oelig;liac axis to liver in
the dorsal view in the cat is seen in <a href="#Fig_223">Fig. 223</a>.)</p>

<p>Figs. 291 and 292 represent schematically cross-sections directly
through the foramen of Winslow, showing the method by means
of which the hepatic artery reaches the upper border of the duodenum
and the effect of the adhesion of duodenum and mesoduodenum
upon the disposition of the vessel.</p>

<p>The coronary artery, like the splenic, is at first situated between
the layers of the dorsal mesogastrium (vertebro-splenic segment).
Like the splenic the coronary artery becomes anchored to the
abdominal background and placed secondarily behind the parietal<span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
peritoneum of the lesser sac by the adhesion of this mesogastric
segment to the primitive parietal peritoneum. To reach the
lesser curvature at the cardia and to run thence from left to right
along the lesser curvature between the layers of the gastro-hepatic
omentum, the vessel raises the investing parietal peritoneum
(originally the right leaf of the dorsal mesogastrium) into a crescentic
fold, extending between its origin from the c&oelig;liac axis at
cephalic margin of pancreas and the beginning of the lesser
curvature of the stomach. Hence this fold is called the left pancreatico-gastric
fold. (Seen well in <a href="#Fig_284">Fig. 284</a>.)</p>

<p>In the next place it must be borne in mind that the relation of
the primitive hepatic artery to the vascular supply of the stomach,
pancreas and duodenum produces a permanent shortening of the
primitive mesentery at this point. This result is indicated in the
schematic figures <a href="#Fig_287">287</a>, <a href="#Fig_288">288</a> and <a href="#Fig_289">289</a>.</p>

<p>In the original condition the dorsal mesentery, passing to a
practically straight intestinal tube, is of uniform sagittal measure
(<a href="#Fig_287">Fig. 287</a>).</p>

<p>As development proceeds, and as the liver grows from the
duodenum, the hepatic artery develops from the primitive pyloric
vessel as above indicated. This vessel, assuming greater importance
with the rapid growth of the liver, is not lengthened out as
happens with the remaining purely intestinal branches which
follow the increase in the length of the intestinal canal. The
hepatic artery, therefore, will mark the point where the original
short sagittal extent of the primitive mesentery will tend to be
preserved. Cephalad of this point the dorsal mesogastrium grows
out into the great omentum (<a href="#Fig_288">Figs. 288</a> and <a href="#Fig_289">289</a>); caudad of the
same point the membrane, in following the development of the
intestine, becomes drawn out into the permanent mesentery and
mesocolon.</p>

<p>The hepatic artery, in addition, marks the cephalic limit of
the adhesion which anchors the duodenum and mesoduodenum
to the parietal peritoneum. Consequently in the adult the vessel
courses in as direct a manner as possible, taking the shortest course<span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
from the c&oelig;liac axis to the liver, passing dorsad of the duodenum
and giving what now appear as secondary branches to
supply the intestine, the stomach and pancreas (pyloric and
gastro-duodenal arteries (pancreatico-duod. superior and gastro-epiploica
dextra)).</p>

<p>Even if no fixation of the duodenum and mesoduodenum
takes place this course of the hepatic artery will produce a constricted
passage between the liver (caudate lobe) cephalad, abdominal
parietes and aorta dorsad, lesser omentum and pyloric duodenum
ventrad, and hepatic artery caudad. This passage leading
from the general peritoneal cavity into the retrogastric space is the
<i>primitive foramen of Winslow</i>. This condition is well represented
in the abdominal cavity of some of the lower mammalia, in
which duodenum and mesoduodenum remain permanently free.</p>

<p>The right kidney is seen in the background, covered by the
parietal peritoneum. The duodenum and mesoduodenum are
free and can be turned toward the median line. The opening of
the foramen of Winslow leading into the retrogastric space is seen
between the liver cephalad, kidney and vena cava dorsad, lesser
omentum and pyloric extremity of the stomach ventrad, and a
fold of peritoneum carrying the hepatic artery caudad. Exactly
similar conditions prevail in the cat and in many other mammals.</p>

<p>It will be seen in all these instances that neither portal vein
nor bile-ducts limit the foramen caudad. These structures can be
lifted up and turned toward the median line with the free duodenum
and mesoduodenum. But the hepatic artery must pass
to the liver from the <i>retroperitoneal c&oelig;liac axis</i>. In doing this
the vessel traverses the cephalic border of the pancreas, and the
pyloric extremity of the stomach and duodenum, to reach the
lesser omentum which conveys it to the liver.</p>

<p>Consequently there must always be a narrow peritoneal neck
between the liver cephalad, aorta dorsad, hepatic artery caudad,
and pyloric extremity of stomach and duodenum together with<span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>
the lesser omentum ventrad. It should be remembered that the
vessel which extends after the development of the liver into the
lesser omentum as the <i>hepatic</i> artery, was originally destined for
the supply of these latter structures. In the adult these primary
embryonic terminal branches to the intestine appear as secondary
branches derived from the hepatic as the main vessel. Their
origin, however, serves to keep the beginning of the small intestine
in comparatively close connection with the hepatic artery
which courses over the dorsal surface of the duodenum to reach
the liver. The narrow space thus left between aorta, hepatic
artery, duodenum, lesser omentum and liver forms the framework
of the foramen of Winslow and appears always as a confined
and narrow channel. This relation is shown in the accompanying
schematic Figs. 294 and 295 which represent a sagittal section
through the foramen. This primitive foramen is thus bounded
cephalad by the liver (caudate lobe, connecting Spigelian and right
lobes), ventrad by the first portion of the duodenum and the
lesser omentum, with hepatic artery behind the intestine and
between the omental layers; dorsad by the abdominal background
and large retroperitoneal vessels, and caudad by the
c&oelig;liac axis and beginning of the hepatic artery.</p>

<p>2. In the forms which possess in the adult an adherent duodenum
and mesoduodenum, as in man, the foramen of Winslow
obtains a secondary caudal limit by the agglutination of the
descending duodenum and the parietal prerenal peritoneum.
This is the secondary and inconstant factor referred to above in
the caudal boundary of the foramen. The result of this anchoring
of duodenum and mesoduodenum is to bring the margin of
the foramen further to the right and to bury the hepatic artery
still further from view. Thus in the adult human subject the
structures bounding the foramen at the margin of the entrance
into the narrow channel would be above caudate lobe of liver,
behind postcava, below duodenum adherent to ventral surface
of right kidney, in front first portion of duodenum and
lesser omentum. The hepatic artery will be felt on introducing<span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
the finger through the foramen in its original position, but it will
be seen that the actual boundaries of the foramen have been
moved so to speak a little further to the right by the duodenal
adhesion.</p>

Collection.)
</div>

<p>Fig. 296 shows a complete dissection of the adult human viscera
and vessels concerned in the formation of the foramen, hardened
in situ.</p>

<p>The stomach is removed, dividing of course the coronary artery
and vein and the left gastro-epiploic artery. The portal vein,
hepatic artery and bile-duct are seen entering and leaving the
liver at the transverse fissure. Behind them and to the right the
vena cava enters the liver. The hepatic artery distributes its pancreatico-duodenal
branches to the duodenum and pancreas. The
left angle of the Spigelian lobe and the fissure for the ductus
venosus appear to the left of the portal vein and hepatic artery.
The right angle of the Spigelian lobe and its continuation into
the right lobe by means of the caudate lobe is hidden by the
structures occupying the transverse fissure. We would enter the
beginning of the foramen of Winslow by passing between the
vena cava behind, the structures in the transverse fissure (portal
vein, hepatic artery and duct) in front, caudate lobe of liver
above and duodenum below, the latter in the undisturbed condition
of the parts adherent to the right kidney. Continuing to
the left the finger would pass between aorta behind, c&oelig;liac axis
and hepatic artery below and in front, and liver above. These
structures bound the permanent and primary narrow channel
of communication between the retrogastric or lesser peritoneal
space and the general peritoneal cavity, which exists even if a free
duodenum and mesoduodenum allow us to lift the intestine away
from vena cava and right kidney.</p>

<p>The main facts pertaining to the structure of the lesser peritoneal
sac and its connection with the greater peritoneal cavity by
means of the foramen of Winslow may be summed up as follows:</p>

folds carrying these vessels appear fused at their beginning, separating the
hepatic recess of the lesser peritoneal sac (<i>A</i>) from the cavity of the omental bursa (<i>C</i>).
</div>

<p>The mesogastrium as a whole, expanding originally in the
sagittal plane in a fan-shaped manner between the vertebral<span class="pagenum" title="186"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span>
column and the ventral abdominal wall, from the level of the
umbilicus to the septum transversum (diaphragm), divides the
cephalic part of the abdominal cavity into a symmetrical right
and left half.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_172">Figs. 172</a> and <a href="#Fig_273">273</a> represent the membrane as seen in a profile
view from the left side. We distinguish the segment dorsad of the
stomach as the dorsal mesogastrium, directly continuous with the
remaining segments of the common primitive dorsal mesentery,
while the portion ventrad of the stomach forms the ventral mesogastrium
in which the liver develops. The segment of the ventral
mesogastrium between liver and stomach becomes the lesser
or gastro-hepatic omentum, while that between liver and ventral
abdominal wall forms the falciform or suspensory ligament.</p>

<p>A transection, showing the dorsal and ventral mesogastrium at
the level of the fundus of the stomach, is given in Fig. 298. The
mesogastria are here seen to be short, while in the schematic <a href="#Fig_291">Figs.
291</a> and <a href="#Fig_292">292</a> the membrane is, for the sake of distinctness, represented
as being of considerable extent.</p>

<p>The ventral mesogastrium surrounding the liver and stomach
extends caudad to include the first portion of the duodenum.
Beyond this point it terminates in a thickened free edge which
includes the umbilical vein. This vein extends from the umbilicus
to the transverse fissure of the liver (Fig. 297), lying within
the umbilical fissure on the caudal surface of the gland.</p>

<p>At the point where the vein enters the liver the thickened
margin of the ventral mesogastrium is continued, as ligamentum
hepato-duodenale, to the upper part of the duodenum and forms
the ventral boundary of the foramen of Winslow. Between
the layers of the mesogastrium which meet in this margin are
situated the portal vein, biliary duct and hepatic artery, together
with the nerves and lymphatics of the liver.</p>

<p>The mesogastrium originally divided the abdominal cavity
between umbilicus and diaphragm into symmetrical right and
left halves of equal size and extent. This early symmetrical
arrangement becomes disturbed about the seventh week by the<span class="pagenum" title="187"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>
rotation of the stomach and the resulting altered course of the
mesogastrium, which render the two original equal halves of the
abdominal cavity unequal and asymmetrical. The original
right half becomes placed behind the stomach and is converted
into a blind sac with its opening directed to the right.</p>

<p>The communication of the general abdominal cavity with the
retrogastric space by means of this channel is still wide in the
embryo, but gradually becomes narrowed in the course of further
development to form the foramen of Winslow. This opening is
situated between the hepato-duodenal ligament and the parietal
peritoneum covering the vena cava. It is constricted from below
by the curve of the hepatic artery as this vessel passes from the
c&oelig;liac axis to reach the liver at the transverse fissure between the
layers of the lesser omentum.</p>

<p>The earlier developmental stages of the higher mammalian
embryos are in general well illustrated by the permanent adult
conditions found in some of the lower vertebrates, in which
development does not proceed beyond the primitive condition.</p>

<p>In reptiles, birds and mammals the epiploic bursa is generally
formed, while in amphibia the dorsal mesogastrium is very short
and connects the stomach directly to the dorsal midline of the
abdominal cavity without forming the sac-like extension of the
great omentum.</p>

<p>The dorsal mesogastrium with the stomach, and the ventral
mesogastrium including the liver between its layers, divides in
these animals the cephalic part of the body cavity into two
halves, corresponding to the earlier embryonic stages in man and
in the higher mammalia.</p>

<p>The foramen of Winslow of the higher forms appears in the
lower vertebrates as the wide-open space leading from below into
the right half of the c&oelig;lom cavity. The dorsal mesogastrium
remains short, not forming the pouch-like extension of the great
omentum. The stomach retains more or less its primitive vertical
position without rotation or elevation of the pyloric extremity, and
the intestinal canal is simple, short and comparatively straight.</p>

<h2>PART III.</h2>

<h2>LARGE AND SMALL INTESTINE, ILEO-COLIC
JUNCTION AND CÆCUM.</h2>


<p>In considering the anatomy of the human cæcum and vermiform
appendix many structural conditions are encountered which
can only be correctly appreciated in the light of the physiology
of the digestive tract. The alimentary canal as a whole affords
one of the most striking examples of the adaptation of structure
to function. The constant renewal of the tissues of the body by
the absorption of nutritive material, the necessary concomitant
egestion of undigestible remnants, the variety in the quantity
and character of the food habitually taken, all serve to explain
why the alimentary canal responds structurally in individual
forms so completely to the physiological demands made upon it.
This will become especially evident if we extend our observations
to include, in addition to man, a review of the corresponding
structures in representative types of the lower vertebrates. Moreover
the human cæcum and appendix are in part rudimentary
structures, representing a portion of the alimentary tract which,
in accordance with altered conditions of food supply and nutrition,
has lost its original functional significance to the organism
and which consequently exhibits the wide range of structural
variation which characterizes the majority of rudimentary and
vestigial organs.</p>

<p>The vermiform process of man and the higher primates is thus
one of several indications given in the structure of the alimentary
canal (the character of the dentition is another example) which
suggests that at one phylogenetic period the forms composing the
order or their immediate ancestors were largely or entirely herbivorous,
and hence possessed a more extensively developed cæcal
apparatus than their omnivorous descendants of to-day. In ap<span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>proaching,
therefore, the study of the human cæcum and appendix
we will at once meet with conditions which call for the
simultaneous physiological and morphological consideration of
the adjacent small and large intestine.</p>

<p>Again many of the structural peculiarities which characterize
the human cæcal apparatus can only be correctly valued by
comparison with the corresponding parts in the lower vertebrates.
Our inquiry will, therefore, most profitably include the
following subdivisions of the subject:</p>


<p>I. General review of the functional and structural characters
of the vertebrate large and small intestine.</p>

<p>II. Systematic consideration of the ileo-colic junction and the
connected structures in the vertebrate series.</p>

<p>III. Phylogeny of the types of vertebrate ileo-colic junction
and cæcum, and their probable lines of evolution.</p>

<p>IV. Detailed morphology of the human cæcum and vermiform
appendix.</p>


<p class="center"><b>I. GENERAL REVIEW OF THE MORPHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY
OF THE VERTEBRATE INTESTINE.</b></p>

<p>We have seen that the intestinal tube of all vertebrates is the
product of two of the embryonal blastodermic layers, the entoderm
and mesoderm. The former furnishes the characteristic and cardinal
elements of the digestive tract, viz., the secretory and absorbing
epithelium of the mucous membrane and of the accessory
digestive glands, the liver and pancreas.</p>

<p>From the mesoderm, on the other hand, are derived the muscular
and connective tissue coats which surround the epithelial
tube and contribute to the thickness of the intestinal wall, as well
as the blood vessels and lymphatics. The alimentary canal separates
from the yolk-sac of the embryo by the development of
cranial, caudal and lateral folds, and at an early period communicates
with the neural canal by the primitive postanal gut (cf. <a href="#Page_23">p.
23</a>). This connection subsequently becomes lost. The oral and
anal openings, by means of which the alimentary canal communi<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>cates
with the exterior, are formed <i>secondarily</i> by entodermal
invaginations which finally break through into the lumen of the
canal (cf. <a href="#Page_24">p.&nbsp;24</a>).</p>

<p>At an early embryonic stage the alimentary canal appears
therefore as a straight cylindrical tube running cephalo-caudad
in the long axis of the body-cavity, and suspended by the
primitive mesentery from the ventral aspect of the chorda
dorsalis.</p>

<p>In Amphioxus, the cyclostomata, certain teleosts, dipn&oelig;ans and
lower amphibians the canal remains permanently in this condition
(cf. <a href="#Fig_310">Fig. 310</a>).</p>

<p>In the remaining vertebrates the uniform non-differentiated
tube of the embryo develops further and appears more or less
distinctly divided into a proximal segment, the <i>foregut</i>, a central
segment, the <i>midgut</i>, and a distal segment, the <i>hindgut</i>, or <i>endgut</i>.
This differentiation of the tube into successive segments is closely
connected with the character and quantity of the food habitually
taken and with the method and rapidity of its elaboration
in the process of digestion, absorption and excretion. In general
the <i>foregut</i> is formed by the segment which succeeds to the oral
cavity, and includes the <i>pharynx</i>, <i>&oelig;sophagus</i> and <i>stomach</i>. The
<i>midgut</i> is composed of a longer or shorter narrower tube of nearly
uniform caliber, the <i>small intestine</i>, which follows the gastric dilatation.
Even in forms in which the stomach is not distinctly
differentiated (cf. <a href="#Page_40">p.&nbsp;40</a>) the connection of the biliary duct with
the intestinal canal serves to separate the fore- and midgut. The
<i>hindgut</i> or <i>large intestine</i> is usually separated from the preceding
segment by an external circular constriction, with a corresponding
annular valve or fold of the mucous membrane in the
interior.</p>

<p>The beginning of the large intestine is marked in many forms
by the development of an accessory pouch or diverticulum, the
<i>cæcum</i>. The hindgut extends from its junction with the midgut
to the cloacal or anal opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span></p>
<p class="center"><b>1. Midgut or Small Intestine.</b></p>

<p>The small intestine is the segment of the alimentary canal in
which digestion of the non-nitrogenous food substances takes
place, and which affords the necessary area of mucous surface for
the absorption of all digested matters. Consequently the character
and habitual quantity of the food here elaborated exerts a
very marked influence on the <i>length</i> of the small intestine, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, on
the extent of the digestive and absorbing surface represented by
its mucous membrane.</p>

<p>The relative length of the small intestine in any individual
form will vary with both the quantity and volume of the food
and with the rapidity of the metabolic processes. Animals, in
which digestion is rapid and the usual food small in bulk and
concentrated in its nutrient qualities, have a relatively short
intestine, while the canal is longer in forms subsisting on food
which is bulky and which demands considerable time for its
elaboration. Hence we find the relatively shortest intestine in
carnivora, the longest in herbivora, while the canal in omnivora
occupies an intermediate position in regard to its relative length.</p>

<p>The rapidity of tissue-metabolism also exerts a marked influence
on the length and development of this portion of the alimentary
canal.</p>

<p>In the warm-blooded animals (mammals and birds) the tissue-changes
are constant and rapid and call for a large amount of
nutrition within a given period, while the metabolic processes in
the cold-blooded vertebrates (reptiles, amphibia and fishes) are
slow, these animals being able to go without food for long periods.
Consequently in the former class the small intestine is relatively
much longer than in the latter. Thus in certain birds and herbivorous
mammals the small intestine exceeds the total length of
the body many times. This influence of the quantity and quality
of the food on the length of the intestinal canal is seen, for example,
very well during the course of development in the frog.</p>

<p>The increase in the length of the intestine, and the consequent
varying degrees of coiling and convolution, are therefore secondary<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>
acquired characters, depending for their development upon
the habitual kind and volume of the food. Additional provisions
for increasing the efficiency of the digestive apparatus are encountered
throughout the whole of the intestinal canal. In many
forms the digestive secretory and absorbing area is augmented
by the development of folds, valves, diverticula, villi and papillæ
from the mucous surface of the intestine. Certain valves and
folds, moreover, both control the direction in which the contents
of the canal move and retain the same for a longer period in the
intestinal segment in which they develop. Such folds appear
especially well developed in the intestine of certain cyclostomes,
selachians and dipn&oelig;ans (cf. <a href="#Fig_203">Figs. 203</a> and <a href="#Fig_204">204</a>). In these forms
the alimentary canal is usually short and straight, and the fold
which has a typical spiral course and projects far into the lumen
of the gut, evidently makes up to a very large extent for the
shortness of the intestine, serving the threefold purpose of</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Increasing the digestive and absorbing surface;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Prolonging the period of retention of the food-substances in
the intestine, and thus increasing the time available for elaboration
and absorption.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Regulating the direction in which the intestinal contents
move.</p>

<p>We will see presently that a similar spiral mucous fold is also
encountered in some of the higher vertebrates, especially in the
large intestine. Examples are found in the well-developed spiral
valve in the cæca of the ostrich (<a href="#Fig_341">Fig. 341</a>), the similar fold in

<a href="#Fig_473">473</a>).</p>

<p>To the same physiological category belong the <i>digestive diverticula</i>
of the intestinal canal, such as the pyloric appendices of the
midgut found in many teleosts and ganoids (cf. <a href="#Page_119">p.&nbsp;119</a>) and the
varieties of cæca or blind diverticula of the hindgut encountered
throughout the vertebrate series. They all function as reservoirs
which increase the available digestive and absorbing surface and<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
which in addition are especially adapted to retain substances
difficult of digestion until the processes of elaboration have been
completed.</p>

<p><b>Divisions of the Small Intestine.</b>&mdash;In the higher forms the segment
of the small intestine which succeeds to the pylorus is distinguished
as the <i>duodenum</i>. Into it empty the ducts of the liver
and pancreas. In some animals a pear-shaped enlargement is
found, corresponding to the <i>duodenal antrum</i> of the human intestine,
as the dilated proximal portion of the duodenum immediately
beyond the pylorus is called. Examples of this condition
are furnished by the cetaceans, several rodents, the llama and
dromedary and the koala (Phascolarctos).</p>

<p>In the birds and in many mammals (<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, dog, <a href="#Fig_200">Fig. 200</a>, and
many rodents, as the rabbit) the duodenum is drawn out into a
long loop surrounding the pancreas.</p>

<p><b>Structure of the Small Intestine.</b> <b>1. Secretory Apparatus.</b>&mdash;The
glands whose ducts empty into the small intestine and which
furnish the digestive secretions, may be divided as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Glands situated in the substance of the intestinal walls.</p>

<p>Two kinds are distinguished:</p>

<p>1. Brunner&rsquo;s glands, small acinous glands confined to the first
part of the duodenum.</p>

<p>2. Glands of Lieberkühn, small cæcal pits distributed not only
over the entire small intestine, but also found in the mucous
membrane of the large intestine.</p>

<p>These structures furnish the intestinal juice, whose chief function
is the conversion of starches into sugar, while aiding in
carnivorous animals also the digestion of proteid substances.
The glands are hence best developed in herbivora, while in
carnivora they are present in diminished numbers since they
assist in the digestion of proteid substances.</p>

<p>The size and number of these glands also depends on the
amount of food digested within a given period. When a considerable
quantity of digestive fluid is required, in order to obtain
the nutritive value of the food for the organism rapidly, the<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>
glandular apparatus of the intestine will be well developed.
Hence mammalia, in whom these conditions exist, possess both
the glands of Brunner and of Lieberkühn. In birds the latter
structures are still found, but the former are absent, while amphibia
and fishes are devoid of both kinds. In these lower vertebrates
the typical intestinal glandular apparatus of the higher
forms is to a certain extent replaced by small pits and depressions
of the mucous membrane bounded by reticular folds.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Glands situated outside the intestinal tube, into whose lumen
their ducts empty.</i></p>

<p>The liver and pancreas fall under this head. The liver functions
in the digestion of the fatty substances of the food, while
the secretion of the pancreas converts the starches into sugars,
and aids in the digestion of albumenoid substances and to a
lesser degree in that of the fats.</p>

<p><b>2. Absorbing Apparatus of Small Intestine.</b>&mdash;The mucous membrane
of the intestine is provided with villi, containing lymphatics, by
whose agency the digested matters are absorbed. These structures
are developed in individual forms in direct proportion to
the ease and rapidity with which the food is habitually absorbed.</p>

<p>The more rapid and complete the digestion is the greater will be
the amount of digested nutritive material at any given time in the
intestine, and the greater will be the development of the absorbing
structures. Hence the villi of the small intestine are especially
large and prominent in the carnivora, while they are small
and insignificant in herbivora and omnivora. Intestinal villi are
found in nearly all mammals and in many birds. Fig. 300 shows
the villi of the intestinal mucous membrane in a carnivore mammal
(<i>Ursus maritimus</i>, polar bear) and Fig. 301 the same structures
in the cassowary (<i>Casuarius casuarius</i>) in which bird they
are very well developed. The villi are not confined to the two
highest vertebrate classes, but are encountered also in the mucous
membrane of the midgut in certain reptiles, notably the ophidia.</p>

with well-developed and prominent villous projections.</p>

<p>Some birds, such as the snipes, herons and crows, have in place
of the intestinal villi projecting folds of the mucosa, often arranged
in a reticular manner. This type is prevalent in amphibia and
fish (<a href="#Fig_112">Fig. 112</a>, distal segment of midgut). Collections of lymphoid
tissue in the mucous membrane of the small intestine, either
aggregated to form Peyer&rsquo;s patches (<a href="#Fig_309">Fig. 309</a>) or as solitary follicles,
are only found in the two highest vertebrate classes, birds
and mammals. In the former they appear scattered over the
surface of the mucous membrane, in the latter they may be
arranged in aggregations or regular rows. They are not secreting
structures, but their exact function in absorption is not known.
This lymphoid or adenoid tissue in certain forms is especially
well developed at the ileo-colic junction, forming the <i>lymphatic
sac</i> of some rodents, as lepus (cf. <a href="#Fig_386">Fig. 386</a>). It is not confined to
the small intestine, but is found in the large intestine as well.
At times it appears especially well developed in the terminal portion
of the cæcal pouch (appendix), as in <i>Lepus</i> (<a href="#Fig_388">Fig. 388</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>valvulæ conniventes</i> or <i>valves of Kerkring</i> of the human small
intestine serve to very greatly increase the secreting and absorbing
mucous surface. They are not found in this complete development
in any other mammals, although a very few forms present
a transverse reduplication of the intestinal mucosa and the
circular layer of muscular fibers. An example of this is found in
the intestinal mucous membrane of a species of antelope, shown
in Fig. 303.</p>

<p>The complete development of the valvulæ conniventes in man
is possibly also associated with a mechanical function in connection
with the upright posture. In some mammalia, as in certain
rodents and the porpoise (Fig. 304), the mucous membrane of the
terminal part of the small intestine is thrown into <i>longitudinal folds</i>.</p>

<p>The mucosa of the midgut in the lower vertebrates may be
smooth, or thrown into longitudinal folds, or the longitudinal
folds may become connected by oblique and transverse secondary
folds, resulting finally in a more or less complicated reticulated
pattern of crypts. A very good example of the type-form from<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>
which the more complicated conditions are derived is seen in
Fig. 305, showing the mucous membrane of the midgut in <i>Lophius
piscatorius</i>, the angler. The specimen is taken 18&nbsp;cm. from the
pylorus and shows a ground plan of longitudinal plicæ connected
by short oblique cross folds.</p>

<p>Fig. 306, showing the midgut mucosa of the loggerhead turtle
(<i>Thalassochelys caretta</i>), exhibits the same arrangement further
developed, resulting in a fine reticulated pattern, while in the
endgut of the same animal the primitive longitudinal folding is
resumed (Fig. 307).</p>

<p>The number and size of the human valvulæ conniventes vary
in different parts of the small intestine (<a href="#Fig_309">Fig. 309</a>). They are not
usually found in the beginning of the duodenum (<a href="#Fig_308">Fig. 308</a>), but
commence in the second or descending portion.</p>

<p>They become very large and closely packed immediately beyond
the common entrance of the biliary and pancreatic ducts
and continue to be well developed and numerous throughout the
rest of the duodenum and upper half of the jejunum (<a href="#Fig_308">Figs. 308</a>
and <a href="#Fig_309">309</a>). From here on they become smaller, more irregular
and less closely packed, and finally in the terminal two feet of the
ileum disappear almost entirely (<a href="#Fig_309">Fig. 309</a>). This varying development
of the valvulæ is the chief reason why a given segment of
the ileum weighs less than a corresponding length of the jejunum.
This reduction in the fold-formation of the intestinal mucosa
toward the terminal portion of the midgut is seen even in the
lower vertebrates. Thus in <a href="#Fig_112">Fig. 112</a>, showing the entire intestinal
tract of the conger eel, <i>Echelus conger</i>, in section, the plicæ
of the mucous membrane in the proximal segment of the midgut,
at and immediately beyond the entrance of the biliary duct, are
prominent and numerous. This redundancy continues but
slightly reduced in the descending limb of the intestinal loop,
while in the ascending limb and up to the ileo-colic junction the
folds are reduced to a fine reticulated meshwork. Beyond the
ileo-colic valve plate, in the short endgut, the mucosa again presents
numerous pointed reduplications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span></p>
<p class="center"><b>II. ENDGUT OR LARGE INTESTINE.</b></p>

<p>In this segment of the intestinal canal the undigested remnants
of the food are collected and evacuated from time to time.</p>

<p>In addition, the mucous membrane of the large intestine absorbs
all <i>digested</i> material which is passed from the small intestine.
While digestion of food-substances will not be <i>inaugurated</i>
in the large intestine, material already in the process of digestion
and mixed with the intestinal juices of the preceding segment,
will be further elaborated in this portion of the canal and the
nutritive products absorbed. This is especially the case in herbivora
and omnivora, whose food is bulky, containing a large
amount of refuse material, and is hence only slowly digested.
On the other hand the food of the carnivora is easily and rapidly
digested and absorbed. After passing through the small intestine
hardly any substances remain which are capable of digestion and
absorption. Hence the large intestine of herbivora and omnivora
is uniformly longer in proportion to the small intestine than it is
in carnivorous animals. In the former this segment of the canal
functions as an accessory digestive apparatus and hence, as we
will see, often develops accessory structural modifications, such as
a large cæcum and spiral colon, while in the latter it acts almost
solely as a canal for the evacuation of the indigestible remnants.</p>

<p>Again, the large intestine is better developed in the higher
animals, in mammalia and to a lesser degree in birds, in whom
the functional demands for nutrition are active and require that
a relatively large amount of food should pass through the digestive
tract in a given time. On the other hand in the lower
cold-blooded vertebrates the metabolism is less active, less food is
taken and it is not necessary to secure all the nutrient material
contained in the same for the organism. The great differences
observed in the vertebrate series in regard to length, width
and structure of the large intestine depend upon these physiological
conditions. The divisions of the human large intestine
into cæcum, ascending, transverse and descending colon, sig<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>moid
flexure and rectum are found only in the primates, and
here not uniformly.</p>

<p>In the lower vertebrate classes the endgut is very short, corresponding
only to the pelvic segment of the Mammalia (rectum),
a colon proper being absent in these forms (cf. <a href="#Fig_112">Fig. 112</a>, <i>Echelus
conger</i>). The human large intestine exhibits a very characteristic
structure. Throughout the greater part of the colon the
longitudinal muscular layer is mainly disposed in the form of
three bands or tænia (ligamenta coli). The canal itself is longer
than these bands, thus producing a folding of the walls in
the form of three rows of pouches (cellulæ coli), in the intervals
between the bands. The pouches of each row are separated from
each other externally by constrictions, internally by projecting
crescentic folds (plicæ coli) (<a href="#Fig_471">Figs. 471</a>, <a href="#Fig_472">472</a> and <a href="#Fig_474">474</a>).</p>

<p>This arrangement of the large intestine is also found in the
monkeys (<a href="#Fig_473">Fig. 473</a>) and in certain Rodents (<a href="#Fig_474">Fig. 474</a>).</p>

<p>In other mammals the large intestine is smooth and cylindrical
and the longitudinal layer of muscular fibers uniform (<a href="#Fig_475">Fig.
475</a>).</p>

<p>In general the vertebrate large intestine is <i>wider</i> than the small,
usually in the proportion of 5:1 or 6:1.</p>

<p>In some ruminant Herbivora, however, the great length of the
colon leads to a reduction of the caliber in certain segments so
that the large intestine does not exceed the width of the small,
or even falls below the same.</p>

<p>The <i>length</i> of the large intestine, as in man, is usually much
less than that of the small intestine. As already stated this
disproportion is more marked in Carnivora than in Herbivora.</p>

<p>The ratio in length of the large to the small intestine is very
low in the Seals (1:14), and in several Edentates, as <i>Myrmecophaga</i>,
<i>Tamandua</i> and <i>Bradypus</i> (1:9-11).</p>

<p>In the carnivorous mammals it ranges 1:5-7.</p>

<p>In some of the ruminant Herbivora, as the cow and sheep, it is
1:4, while in the deer, horse, certain Rodents (as <i>Lepus</i> and <i>Cricetus</i>)
it reaches as high as 1:2 or 1:3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="200"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span></p>

<p>The large intestine is usually relatively short in birds, reptiles,
amphibia and fish.</p>

<p>In the Cassowary the length of the large to the small intestine
is 1:6.</p>

<p>In some of the birds of prey (eagle) the proportion falls as low
as 1:68 or 70.</p>

<p>Exceptions to the general rule are furnished by some of the
herbivorous Cetaceans and by the Dugong (<i>Halicore</i>) in whom
the large intestine is twice as long as the small. Again in the
Ostrich the large intestine in one example measured 40&#8242;, while
the length of the small intestine was only 22&#8242;. This unusual
development of the large intestine indicates the necessity of
retaining the food, which is bulky and difficult of digestion, until
the elaboration is completed. The same significance belongs to
the enormously developed cæca of these birds (cf. <a href="#Page_204">p.&nbsp;204</a>).</p>

<p>The separation of the small and large intestine is marked
externally by the <i>cæcum</i>, when present, and internally by the
<i>valve of the colon</i>. The details of the vertebrate ileo-colic junction
will be considered in the following pages.</p>


<p class="center"><b>II. SERIAL REVIEW OF THE ILEO-COLIC JUNCTION AND CONNECTED<br />

pyloro-duodenal valve. There is no cæcum, and the short hindgut
empties into the cephalic and ventral aspect of the cloaca.
Fig. 311 shows the entire intestinal tract of a Teleost fish, <i>Echelus

<p class="center fs90"><b>III. REPTILIA.</b></p>

<p>In reptiles a well-marked differentiation of small and large
intestine is the rule.</p>

<p>Four types of ileo-colic junction are encountered in this class:</p>

<p>1. The transition from small to large intestine is marked by the
greatly increased caliber of the latter and by an annular valve
in the interior. An example of this type is furnished by <i>Alligator
mississippiensis</i> (Fig. 321) and a similar form is encountered in
some lizards, as <i>Heloderma suspectum</i>, the Gila monster (Fig. 322).</p>

<p>2. The large intestine immediately beyond the ileo-colic junction
protrudes along the convex border to form a rudimentary
lateral cæcum. This type is found in many Chelonians, <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, in
<i>Pseudemys elegans</i>, the pond turtle (Figs. 323 and 324) and <i>Chelydra

<p>3. The ileo-colic junction is provided with a well-developed
sacculated cæcal pouch derived from the proximal segment of
the colon and divided in the interior by folds into several
secondary compartments.</p>

<p>This type is found in some of the phytophagous lizards, as
<i>Iguana tuberculata</i> (Figs. 326 and 327). The small intestine of
this animal is of considerable length and of uniform caliber from
the pylorus to the ileo-colic junction. The cæcum is a large sacculated
pouch developed chiefly along the convex border of the
large intestine opposite to the mesenteric attachment.</p>

</div></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The examination of the interior of this pouch reveals a complicated
structure (Figs. 328 and 329). Fig. 330 shows the same
structures in a closely allied form, <i>Cyclura teres</i>. The entrance of
the small intestine is guarded by an annular sphincter valve,
whose central circular opening leads into a proximal compartment
of the cæcum. This compartment is in turn separated
from the remainder of the cæcal pouch by a second circular valvular
fold with central opening. Beyond this valve the interior
of the pouch carries a number of crescentic mucous folds, corresponding
to the external constrictions between the cæcal sacculations.
The entire pouch gradually diminishes in caliber and
finally passes with a sharp angular bend into the terminal portion
of the endgut. At this point the lumen of the canal is slightly
diminished by a sphincter-like thickening of the muscularis, producing
an annular projection of the mucous membrane. The
entire cæcal pouch appears as a specialized segment of the large
intestine interposed between the termination of the midgut and
the terminal portion of the endgut, which latter is characterized
by uniform caliber and increased thickness of the muscular walls.</p>

<p>The highly developed and complicated structure of the cæcal
apparatus in <i>Iguana</i> and allied forms exemplifies very clearly the
influence of <i>vegetable</i> food on the development of this segment of
the alimentary tract when compared with the simple type of ileo-colic
transition found in <i>carnivorous</i> lizards, as <i>Heloderma</i> (<a href="#Fig_322">Fig.
322</a>). <i>Iguana</i> subsists on leaves, fruits and other vegetable matter<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
and the cæcal pouch is invariably found filled with the firmer
and less digestible portions of this food. These are undoubtedly
retained in the pouch by the series of valves and folds until
digestion and absorption of all available nutritive material forwarded
from the small intestine is completed. On the other
hand <i>Heloderma</i> lives almost entirely on bird eggs, a concentrated
and easily digested food. Consequently the ileo-colic junction
in this lizard is exceedingly simple and rudimentary, marked
merely by a slight external constriction, with an annular valve
in the interior, and an increase in the caliber of the short hindgut,
resembling the form found in many teleost fishes.</p>

<p>4. Finally in some Ophidians a typical lateral cæcal pouch of
considerable dimensions is found connected with the endgut immediately
beyond the ileo-colic junction.</p>

<p>An example of this reptilian type, closely resembling the corresponding
structure in many Mammalia, is presented by <i>Eunectes
marinus</i>, the anaconda, shown in Figs. 331 and 332.</p>

<p class="center fs90"><b>IV. ILEO-COLIC JUNCTION IN BIRDS.</b></p>

<p>In the birds the length of the intestine is subject to great variations.
The canal is short in species subsisting on fruits and
insects, long in those feeding on seeds, plants and fish. The large
intestine, immediately beyond the ileo-colic junction, is provided
typically with two symmetrical lateral cæca which extend in some
forms for a considerable distance cephalad on each side of the
small intestine to which they are bound by peritoneal connections.</p>

etc., have fairly long cæca (Fig. 337). In the passerine birds
living on seeds and insects, the cæca are of considerable length
as they are also in some of the piscivorous divers (<a href="#Fig_338">Figs. 338</a> and
<a href="#Fig_339">339</a>). They are long in the Ratitæ, and in the Lamellirostra,

<p class="center"><b>I. Order: Monotremata.</b></p>

<p>In many particulars the anatomical structure of these animals
reveals a close relationship to the Sauropsida. They represent the
mammalian class in its lowest stage of evolution.</p>

<p>The ileo-colic junction in all the existing forms is direct, without
angular bend at the entrance of the small into the large
intestine. The cæcum is a long narrow pouch, slightly dilated
at the extremity, derived from the beginning of the colon and
extending backward along the free margin of the small intestine.
The cæcum resembles in its general shape and structure the
pouches seen in many birds, except that it is unilateral, while
the birds normally have two symmetrical cæca. The cæcum of
<i>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</i>, the platypus or duck bill, is shown
in Figs. 345 and 346, and that of <i>Echidna hystrix</i>, the spiny ant-eater,
in Fig. 347. These two animals represent the two genera
into which the order is divided.</p>

<p>The Didelphia are represented by numerous species, which are
united by certain common anatomical characters of the reproductive
organs and dentition to form the order of the Marsupialia.
The individual species included within this order differ widely in<span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
abit, food, mode of locomotion, etc., and consequently exhibit
great diversity in the structure of the skeletal and muscular systems
and of the alimentary canal. With the exception of the
Opossums inhabiting the new world, the families composing the
order are confined to the Australian continent and the adjacent
islands. In respect to the alimentary tract in general and the ileo-colic
junction in particular, we are evidently dealing with a group
of animals which, while they retain the common characters above
indicated as uniting them in the marsupial order, yet have in the
structure of their digestive canal adapted themselves to widely
divergent conditions of food supply and environment. Consequently
within the confines of this single and largely isolated order,
we encounter nearly all the types of cæcum and ileo-colic junction
which are found among the remaining mammalia. The group in its
individual representatives has passed, so to speak, through the different
stages of development and evolution which, on a very much
larger scale, are exhibited by the remaining mammalian orders.</p>

<p>We can, independently of the systematic zoölogical classification,
arrange the forms composing the order under the following types:</p>

<p>1. <i>Forms with large well-developed simple cæca, of uniform caliber,
with rounded globular termination.</i></p>

<p>This type is encountered among the herbivorous Marsupials,
such as the opossums, kangaroos and wallabys. Fig. 348 shows
the structures in <i>Didelphis virginiana</i>, the common opossum, Fig.
349 in a small species of opossum from Trinidad, and Fig. 350

<p>5. <i>Forms with simple direct ileo-colic junction without cæcum.</i></p>

<p>In the purely carnivorous Marsupials, comprising the family of
the <i>Dasyuridæ</i>, the reduction of the cæcal apparatus, foreshadowed
by the appearance of the distal rudimentary segment as a vermiform
appendix in the wombats, has been carried to the complete
elimination of the pouch. The ileo-colic junction in these animals
is simple, marked externally by a circular constriction and internally
by an annular valve. The colon forms a very short terminal

<p>The structural modifications encountered in the digestive tract
of these carnivorous Marsupials can properly be regarded as the
result of their habitual diet, and we will meet with analogous and
identical examples of cæcal reduction in the typical Carnivores

<p class="center"><b>III. Subclass: Monodelphia.</b></p>

<p class="center"><b>III. Order: Edentata.</b></p>

<p>In all probability the Sloths, Ant-eaters and Armadillos composing
this order represent a highly specialized remnant of an ancient
group now largely extinct. In respect to the ileo-colic junction the
Edentates may be arranged in two groups which offer, within the<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
limited number of existing species, a very complete transitional
series.</p>


<p class="center">I. <span class="smcap">Symmetrical Type of Ileo-colic Junction.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Differentiation in caliber, with direct funnel-like transition of
small into large intestine. No cæcum.</i></p>

<p>Beyond the ileo-colic junction the caliber of the large intestine
increases gradually. The terminal ileum is thus implanted into
the apex of a funnel formed by the proximal segment of the
colon.</p>

<p>Examples of this type are furnished by <i>Myrmecophaga jubata</i>,
the great ant-eater (Fig. 356), and by <i>Chol&oelig;pus didactylus</i>, the two-toed
sloth (Fig. 357).</p>

</div>

<p>2. <i>Abrupt demarcation of small and large intestine, with median
transition of ileum.</i></p>

<p>The caliber of the intestine enlarges rapidly immediately beyond
the ileo-colic junction. This form is derived from the preceding
by the substitution of the abrupt ileo-colic transition for the
gradual funnel-shaped development of the large intestine.</p>

<p>The type is illustrated by <i>Tatusia novemcincta</i>, the nine-banded
armadillo (Fig. 358), and is also found in two other armadillos,
<i>Tolypeutes</i> and <i>Xenurus</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>The colon on each side of the ileo-colic junction is prolonged
backward along the small intestine, forming two symmetrical lateral
globular colic cæca.</i></p>

<p>This type, which is to be regarded as a further development of
the preceding form, is also found in the armadillos. Fig. 359
represents the structures in <i>Dasypus sexcinctus</i>, the six-banded
armadillo, and a similar arrangement of the parts exists in
<i>Chlamydophorus</i>, another species of armadillo.</p>

</div>

<p>4. <i>The cæcal pouches are more completely differentiated, communicating
with the colon by a constricted neck.</i></p>

<p>This results in an arrangement which recalls the structure of
many avian cæca (cf. <a href="#Fig_337">Fig. 337</a>) and is seen in the double cæcal
pouches of <i>Cyclothurus didactylus</i>, the little ant-eater (Fig.

<p class="center">II. <span class="smcap">Asymmetrical Type of Ileo-colic Junction.</span></p>

<p>The second general group of the Edentates is characterized by
the gradual development of a single lateral asymmetrical cæcum,
in place of the median symmetrical ileo-colic transition found in
the forms just considered. The species composing this group thus
form a link leading up to the right-angled accession of ileum to
large intestine and the lateral cæcum characteristic of most other
mammalia.</p>

<p>1. This type may be considered as being inaugurated by the
form of ileo-colic junction found in the <i>Manidæ</i> or <i>Pangolins</i>, as
illustrated by Figs. 361 and 362, taken from the long-tailed
pangolin, <i>Manis longicauda</i>. There is no cæcum and only a
slight differentiation in caliber between the small and large intestine.
The gut in all the forms examined shows a very characteristic
bend at the ileo-colic junction, being twisted into a figure of
8 and held in place by mesenteric folds.</p>

<p>2. The second stage, illustrated by <i>Arctopithecus (Bradypus)
marmoratus</i>, the three-toed sloth (Fig. 363), reveals a distinct increase
in the caliber and convexity of the large intestine opposite
the mesenteric border immediately beyond the ileo-colic
junction.</p>

<p>3. This leads in the third stage, represented by <i>Tamandua bivittata</i>,
the Tamandua ant-eater (Figs. 364 and <a href="#Fig_365">365</a>), to the development
of a distinct lateral cæcal pouch. I have had no opportunity
of examining the structures in <i>Orycteropus</i>, but from the

<p class="center"><b>VI. Order: Ungulata.</b></p>

<p>The intestinal canal, in conformity with the herbivorous habit
of the group, is uniformly provided with a large cæcum, and in
many forms the proximal segment of the colon immediately beyond
the ileo-colic junction is more or less extensively coiled in a
spiral manner. This arrangement is, without doubt, to be regarded
as being functionally accessory to the cæcal apparatus, in the sense
of increasing very much the area of the secreting and absorbing
surface and of prolonging the period during which food-substances,
which are slow and difficult of elaboration, are retained in this
segment of the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>This suborder is formed by the single family of the <i>Hyracidæ</i>.
In addition to their other isolated and puzzling structural peculiarities
the members of this small group present a most unusual
arrangement of the intestinal canal, which is unique among living
mammalia. In addition to a large sacculated cæcal pouch, situated
in the usual position at the beginning of the colon, the large
intestine is provided further on with two supplementary elongated
pointed conical pouches (Fig. 378).</p>

<p>This unique arrangement, which is not found in any other
known vertebrate, may possibly be led back to a type-form
encountered in certain saurians (see <a href="#Page_234">p.&nbsp;234</a>).</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">4. Suborder: Proboscidea.</span></p>

<p>The cæcum of the elephant is a very large sacculated pouch
with rounded termination, illustrated in Fig. 379, taken from the
Asiatic elephant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="211"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span></p>
<p class="center"><b>VII. Order: Rodentia.</b></p>

<p>With the exception of a single group, the dormice (<i>Myoxus</i>)
(Fig. 380), the rodents possess a well-developed cæcal apparatus.</p>

<p>In some forms the terminal portion of the pouch is reduced so
as to constitute an appendix. Many of these animals, in addition
to the cæcum proper, have the proximal colon elongated and
coiled in a spiral, and in some this part of the large intestine is
provided in the interior with a spiral mucous fold. This latter
structure functions again to increase the extent of the mucous
absorbing surface and to prolong the retention of substances
undergoing slow digestion and absorption.</p>

<p>Typical examples of the capacious sacculated rodent cæcum,
with a terminal pointed reduced segment, are afforded by <i>Castor
fiber</i>, the beaver (Figs. 381 and <a href="#Fig_382">382</a>) and by <i>Erethizon dorsatus</i>,

proximal segment of the colon is provided with a complete spiral
valve (<a href="#Fig_387">Fig. 387</a>), while the appendix is differentiated by the histological
character of its mucous membrane which is studded with
closely packed adenoid follicles (<a href="#Fig_388">Fig. 388</a>). A similar aggregation
of lymphoid tissue is found in this animal at the ileo-colic junction
forming the s. c. <i>saccus lymphaticus</i> (<a href="#Fig_387">Fig. 387</a>).</p>

<p>Among the ailuroid carnivora, the hyæna and the lion occupy
an isolated position in regard to the cæcum. Both of these
animals possess a well-developed long cæcal pouch with blunt
extremity (Figs. 416 and 417). They probably afford examples
of a persistent ancestral common type from which the remaining
carnivorous forms are derived by reduction of the cæcal apparatus
in conformity with the food-habits of these animals. The cæcum
of both the lion and hyæna resembles very closely the pouch
of the herbivorous marsupials, such as <i>Halmaturus</i> or <i>Didelphis</i>
(cf. <a href="#Fig_348">Figs. 348</a> and <a href="#Fig_350">350</a>, <a href="#Page_205">p.&nbsp;205</a>).</p>

<p>In the true Insectivora the cæcum is also absent and the alimentary
canal a simple non-differentiated tube.</p>

<p>In certain herbivorous animals included in this group on the

<p class="center"><b>XI. Order: Primates.</b></p>

<p>The cæcum is uniformly present. In certain of the Lemuroidea
the terminal portion of the pouch is reduced, forming a species of
appendix. A typical vermiform appendix is regularly found in
man and in the anthropoid apes, orang, gibbon, chimpanzee and
gorilla.</p>

<p>In the typical lemurs the cæcum is long, frequently terminating
in a pointed appendage. The proximal segment of the colon is
looped and coiled, resembling the spiral colon of the Ungulates
and Rodents. Fig. 420 shows the cæcum of <i>Nycticebus tardigradus</i>,
the slow lemur, with the typical appendage, and <a href="#Fig_421">Fig. 421</a>
shows the spiral arrangement of the proximal colon immediately

is relatively well-developed, but forms a simple pouch of uniform
diameter, without terminal reduction.</p>

cæcal transition types which lead up to the anthropomorphous
type, illustrating the following conditions:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The inherent crescentic curve of the cæcum, with the concavity
directed toward the left, and carrying the apex of the pouch
upward toward the lower border of the ileum and the ileo-colic
junction. (<i>Hapalidæ</i>, <i>Ateles</i>, <i>Lagothrix</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The reduction in caliber of the terminal part, foreshadowing
by the pointed and narrow extremity of the pouch the appearance
of the appendix in the anthropomorphous group. (<i>Hapalidæ</i>,
<i>Ateles</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The constriction at the level of the ileo-cæcal junction, with
the corresponding well-marked differentiation between cæcum and
colon in the interior. (<i>Ateles.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The sharp bend in the pouch as it makes its turn upward
and to the left, repeated in certain types of adult human cæca (cf.
<a href="#Page_247">p.&nbsp;247</a>). (<i>Lagothrix.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Pithecia</i> forms a transitive type between the blunt sacculated
cæca of the Cynomorpha and the curved pointed pouches of

<p>The cæcum is funnel-shaped, gradually narrowing to the origin

sweep of the funnel to the left and upwards is characterized by
the curved course of the ventral longitudinal muscular band
(Fig. 458), whose fibers spread out over a surface 3&nbsp;cm. wide.
The apex is thus placed behind the terminal ileum close to its
entrance into the large intestine.</p>

<p class="center"><b>II. PHYLOGENY OF THE TYPES OF ILEO-COLIC JUNCTION<br />
AND CÆCUM IN THE VERTEBRATE SERIES.</b></p>

<p>The segments of the alimentary canal illustrate very clearly the
adaptation of structure to function. Diversity of kind and quantity
of food habitually taken and variations in the rapidity of tissue
metabolism produce marked morphological modifications in different
forms. This is more especially the case with the junction
of the mid- and hindgut, the site of development of the cæcal apparatus
and of structural alterations of the large intestine possessing
a similar physiological significance. No other portion of the<span class="pagenum" title="218"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span>
visceral tract, with the possible exception of the stomach, illustrates
more completely the result of physiological demand on the
development of anatomical structure and the morphological possibilities
of departure, progressive and retrograde, from a common
primitive type in accordance with varying conditions of
alimentation.</p>

<p>In coördinating, from the morphological standpoint, the structural
differences encountered in this segment of the alimentary
canal, two facts become apparent.</p>

<p>1. In the first place the serial study of the ileo-colic junction,
as we can briefly define the region in question by borrowing the
terminology of anthropotomy, reveals a limited number of principal
structural types from which by successive gradations the vast
variety of individual forms may be derived.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/fig465.jpg" width="500" height="622" alt="" />
<span class="smcap"><a id="Fig_465"></a>Fig. 465.</span>&mdash;Schematic table of the vertebrate types of ileo-colic junction.
</div>

<p>(In the schematic Fig. 465 the fundamental types and their
derivatives are indicated. In the following the individual forms
illustrating these types are referred to this schema in brackets.)</p>

<p>2. The observer will be impressed by the fact that representatives
of all the main types of ileo-colic junction are found within
a very limited zoölogical range, as within the confines of a single
order. Examples of this are furnished by the Marsupialia and, to
a lesser extent, by the Edentata. The members of these zoölogical
groups, while united by certain common anatomical characters,
such as the reproductive system and dentition, differ widely in
habit and in the kind and quantity of the food normally taken.
These differences in the method of nutrition have impressed their
influence on the structure of the alimentary canal and have led
to the evolution of varying and divergent types of ileo-colic junction.
The study of this segment of the intestinal tract can therefore
elucidate the mutual relationship of the vertebrate groups
only to a limited degree and in special cases. On the other hand,
it renders very clear the fundamental structural ground-plan
common to all vertebrates and accentuates the specialized modifications
of this plan which develop in response to the physiological
environment. Moreover, such a review serves to reveal the<span class="pagenum" title="219"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>
significance of rudimentary and vestigial structures, such as the
human vermiform appendix and the serous and vascular folds
connected with the same. Throughout the entire vertebrate
series the alimentary canal is found to respond with great readiness
in its structure to varying grades of functional demand.
This fact becomes still more apparent if the inquiry is not limited
strictly to the region of the ileo-colic junction but takes into
account likewise the structural modifications of similar physiological
significance in other segments of the alimentary tract.</p>

<p>A cæcal pouch or diverticulum in some form at the junction
of mid- and hindgut is a very common and widely distributed
mammalian character. The activity of the tissue-changes in
warm-blooded animals, and the consequent necessity for a rapid
and complete digestive process, account for the structural modifications
of the alimentary tract so commonly encountered among
these forms. On the other hand, in the lower cold-blooded vertebrates,
notably in fishes and amphibians, the metabolism is
slow and the alimentary canal usually simple.</p>

<p>Specifically, the cæcum appears as a pouch or diverticulum in
which food-substances, already partially digested and mixed with
the secretions of the small intestine, are retained until their elaboration
is completed and the nutritive value of the food ingested
is secured for the organism. Consequently the most complicated
and highly developed cæcal apparatus is found among mammalia
in the Herbivora, such as the Ungulates and Rodents, whose food
contains a comparatively small amount of nutriment in ratio to
its bulk, and hence requires considerable elaboration before absorption.
On the other hand the cæcum appears as a reduced or even
rudimentary organ, or defaults entirely, in Carnivora whose food
is concentrated and easily assimilated, containing only a small
amount of non-nutritive material.</p>

<p>The function of the cæcal apparatus may be defined as
follows:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">

<p>1. It provides space for the retention of partly digested substances,
and of such as are difficult of digestion, mixed with the<span class="pagenum" title="220"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span>
secretions of the preceding intestinal segment, until the digestive
elaboration is completed.</p>

<p>2. It increases the intestinal mucous surface for absorption, and
may develop, in certain cases, special localized areas of lymphoid
tissue.</p>

<p>These two functional characters may be shared by other segments
of the intestinal tract, which undergo corresponding structural
modifications. It is only necessary to refer in this connection
to the extreme morphological variations encountered in
the stomach. The intestinal canal proper, however, in many
instances exhibits structural peculiarities which possess the functional
significance of the cæcal apparatus. Thus the projection
into the lumen of the canal of a series of mucous folds, or the
development of a continuous spiral mucous valve, evidently serves
the double purpose of prolonging the period during which the
intestinal contents are retained, and of increasing the intestinal
mucous surface for absorption.</p>

<p>This spiral mucous fold is encountered in the straight intestinal
canal of the Cyclostomata (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>IV</i>, 1, and <a href="#Fig_310">Fig. 310</a>), Selachians
(<a href="#Fig_466">Figs. 466</a> and 467) and Dipn&oelig;ans (Fig. 468). Phylogenetically
it is a very old structure, for evidences of its existence are found
in the fossil remains of some Elasmobranchs. In the Ostrich (<a href="#Fig_341">Fig.
341</a>) the enormously developed cæca possess the same spiral mucous
fold in the interior. The direct combination of the cæcum
and spiral fold is again seen in certain mammalia, as in <i>Lepus</i> (<a href="#Fig_387">Fig.
387</a>). In some Ophidians the same physiological purpose is served
by the manner in which the convolutions of the long intestine are
bound together by a subperitoneal arachnoid membrane. The
lumen of the canal is thus made to assume a spiral course (<a href="#Fig_331">Figs.
331</a> and 469). The mucous folds of the human intestine, both
the valvulæ conniventes and the crescentic folds of the large
intestine, represent the same spiral valve, perhaps modified and
influenced by the erect posture of man (<a href="#Fig_470">Figs. 470</a>-<a href="#Fig_475">475</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>A second modification of the intestinal canal, suggesting the
same physiological interpretation as the ileo-colic cæcum, is presented<span class="pagenum" title="221"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></span>
by the so-called pyloric cæca or appendices of many Teleosts
and Ganoids already referred to (<a href="#Page_119">p.&nbsp;119</a>). While these structures
in some forms very probably have assumed a secretory function
(Figs. 476 and 477), they evidently act in others as diverticula in
which material undergoing digestion is retained, while they increase
at the same time the intestinal mucous secretory and absorbing
surface (<a href="#Fig_478">Figs. 478</a> and <a href="#Fig_479">479</a>). They thus correspond physiologically
to the ileo-colic cæcum. In this connection it is interesting
to note that in Ganoids, which possess both the pyloric appendices
and the spiral valve, the two structures develop in inverse ratio
to each other, indicating their functional identity. In the serial
review of the structure and significance of the vertebrate cæcum
and ileo-colic junction these functionally allied modifications of
other segments of the intestinal canal deserve notice.</p>

<p>The study of the vertebrate ileo-colic junction proper begins
both ontogenetically and phylogenetically with the consideration
of the primitive type in which the alimentary tube is not differentiated
into successive segments and in which consequently no
distinction between mid- and hindgut is found (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>). An
example of this primitive condition is presented by the Cyclostomata,
in whom the alimentary canal traverses the c&oelig;lom cavity
as a straight non-differentiated cylindrical tube. <a href="#Fig_310">Fig. 310</a> shows
the alimentary canal of the Lamprey, <i>Petromyzon marinus</i>, and it
will be observed that the intestine is provided with the spiral
mucous fold above mentioned.</p>

<p>From this fundamental type the following main groups are to
be derived:</p>

<p class="center"><b>I. Symmetrical Form of Ileo-colic Junction. Mid- and Endgut in
Direct Linear Continuity. (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, I.)</b></p>

<p>1. <i>Ileo-colic junction marked externally by an annular constriction,
corresponding to a ring-valve with central circular opening in the interior</i>
(<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>I</i>, 1).</p>

<p>This form is encountered in many Teleosts. The projecting
annular mucous fold resembles the pyloro-duodenal valve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="222"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig_311">Figs. 311</a>-<a href="#Fig_315">315</a> illustrate the structures in representative Teleosts.</p>

<p>Among the higher forms this type of ileo-colic junction is encountered
in the simple alimentary canal of many Amphibians
(<a href="#Fig_318">Figs. 318</a>-<a href="#Fig_320">320</a>). Among Reptiles it is found in certain lizards, as
in <i>Heloderma suspectum</i>, the gila monster (<a href="#Fig_322">Fig. 322</a>). This animal
lives almost entirely upon bird&rsquo;s eggs, and its simple and reduced
ileo-colic junction contrasts strongly with the highly developed
and complicated cæcal apparatus of the phytophagous lizards, as
<i>Iguana</i> (<a href="#Fig_326">Figs. 326</a>-<a href="#Fig_330">330</a>), affording one of the most striking illustrations
of the effect which the character of the food habitually taken
has on the structure of the alimentary canal in forms otherwise
closely allied.</p>

<p>The same type of ileo-colic junction, as a reduction form, occurs
in the arctoid group of Carnivora among Mammalia (cf. <a href="#Page_212">p.&nbsp;212</a>).</p>

<p>2. <i>Differentiation in caliber of large and small intestine. Funnel-shaped
ileo-colic transition.</i></p>

<p>This type, compared with the preceding, is characterized (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig.
465</a>, <i>I</i>, 2) by the greatly increased caliber of the large intestine, resulting
in a funnel-shaped transition between mid- and hindgut, the
small intestine continuing into the colon at the apex of the funnel.</p>

<p>Examples of this type are presented by several Edentates, <i>Myrmecophaga
jubata</i>, the great ant-eater (<a href="#Fig_356">Fig. 356</a>), and <i>Chol&oelig;pus
didactylus</i>, the two-toed sloth (<a href="#Fig_357">Fig. 357</a>).</p>

<p>3. <i>Abrupt demarcation of small and large intestine with caliber
differentiation</i> (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>I</i>, 3).</p>

<p>The small intestine is still central at the ileo-colic junction,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the axis of its lumen is continuous with the central axis of the
colic lumen. In place of the gradual funnel-shaped transition of
the preceding type the demarcation is abrupt.</p>

<p>An example of this form is furnished by another Edentate,
<i>Tatusia peba</i>, the nine-banded armadillo (<a href="#Fig_358">Fig. 358</a>).</p>

<p>Among reptiles a similar well-marked ileo-colic transition is
encountered in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i> (<a href="#Fig_321">Fig. 321</a>).</p>

<p>4. <i>Colic pouch prolonged back on each side of the ileo-colic junction,
producing symmetrical colic cæca</i> (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>I</i>, 4).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="223"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span></p>

<p>A growth of the colic tube cephalad, on each side of the junction
with the midgut, leads to the formation of this type, characterized
by the presence of two symmetrical globular cæcal pouches.
In its simplest form this condition is illustrated by the double
colic cæca of another armadillo, <i>Dasypus sexcinctus</i> (<a href="#Fig_359">Fig. 359</a>).</p>

<p>The bifid cæcal apparatus of the American manatee (<a href="#Fig_366">Fig. 366</a>)
belongs to the same group.</p>

<p>5. <i>Cæcal pouches of the birds</i> (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>I</i>, 5).&mdash;A continuation of
the backward extension of the bilateral colic pouches leads to the
production of the typical double avian cæca in a greater or lesser
degree of development. Frequently the cæca differentiate more
completely from the colon, appearing as pouches of varying
capacity joined to the large intestine by a narrower neck.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_334">Figs. 334</a>-<a href="#Fig_341">341</a> show the well-developed pouches as they appear
in representative avian types, while <a href="#Fig_333">Fig. 333</a> illustrates the reduction
of the cæcal apparatus encountered in many carnivorous birds.</p>

<p>6. Among mammalia <i>Cyclothurus didactylus</i> (<a href="#Fig_360">Fig. 360</a>), the little
ant-eater, furnishes an example of double symmetrical globular
cæca, connected with the colon by a narrow neck (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>I</i>, 6).
Reference to the schema given in <a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a> will show that the types
heretofore examined all have the following common character:</p>

<p>They appear derived from the primitive type by a differentiation
in the caliber of the gut and by the gradual development of
<i>symmetrical bilateral</i> cæcal pouches, resulting in central median
implantation of the small intestine and its direct continuity
with the colon.</p>


<p class="center"><b>II. Asymmetrical Development of a Single Cæcal Pouch, Lateral
to the Ileo-colic Junction, Mid- and Endgut Preserving
Their Linear Continuity. (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, II.)</b></p>

<p>In the second general group the symmetry of the ileo-colic
junction is disturbed. The following types are encountered, forming
a series of successive stages:</p>

<p>1. The increase in the caliber of the large intestine is chiefly
marked along the border opposite to the mesenteric attachment,<span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
resulting in a greater degree of convexity in this part of the
intestinal wall (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>II</i>, 1). Among Reptilia this condition
is found in the ileo-colic junction of some of the pond-turtles, as
<i>Pseudemys elegans</i> (<a href="#Fig_323">Fig. 323</a>), while a mammalian example is furnished
by the three-toed sloth, <i>Arctopithecus marmoratus</i> (<a href="#Fig_363">Fig.
363</a>).</p>

<p>2. An increase of this lateral extension of the colon leads to the
formation of a single lateral cæcal pouch (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>II</i>, 2) such as
is seen in another Edentate, <i>Tamandua bivittata</i> (<a href="#Fig_364">Fig. 364</a>), among
Mammalia, and in certain Ophidians among Reptiles, as in the
<i>Anaconda</i> (<a href="#Fig_331">Figs. 331</a> and <a href="#Fig_332">332</a>).</p>

<p>3. Prolongation of the pouch and reduction in caliber lead to
the formation of the slender lateral cæcum found in all the
Monotremes (<a href="#Fig_345">Figs. 345</a>-<a href="#Fig_347">347</a>, <a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>I</i>, 3). In its general appearance
the cæcum of these singular animals bears a close resemblance
to the cæcal pouches of many birds.</p>

<p>4. Direct continuity of small and large intestine, with lateral
colic cæcum, extending along the convex free border of the terminal
ileum and slightly convoluted at the extremity (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig.
465</a>, <i>II</i>, 4), characterizes the entire group of the <i>Cebidæ</i> among the
new-world monkeys. The cæcum in these animals is a comparatively
long pouch, nearly equalling in caliber the remainder
of the intestine, occupying a distinctly <i>lateral</i> position, with
the terminal portion rounded and slightly recurved (<a href="#Fig_453">Figs. 453</a>
and <a href="#Fig_454">454</a>).</p>

<p>5. The <i>Cynoid group</i> of Carnivora, including the dogs, wolves,
jackals and foxes, presents a similar relative position of small and
large intestine and cæcum (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>II</i>, 5). The cæcum, compared
with that of <i>Cebus</i>, is longer and more highly convoluted (<a href="#Fig_397">Fig.
397</a>). Variations encountered in certain forms indicate reversions
to a more primitive type. Thus <a href="#Fig_398">Fig. 398</a> shows the usual
form in the dog, while <a href="#Fig_399">Fig. 399</a> exhibits an occasional type in the
same animal. The cæcum here is less twisted and indicates
the probable derivation of the more commonly encountered
type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="225"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span></p>

<p class="center"><b>III. Rectangular Ileo-colic Junction with Direct Linear Continuity of
Cæcum and Colon. (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, III.)</b></p>

<p>The third general group, to which the large majority of
Mammalia belong, is characterized in its typical form by a
right-angled entrance of ileum into large intestine and by the
direct caudal prolongation of the colon into a cæcal pouch of
nearly uniform caliber with globular termination. The axes of
the small and large intestine are not in the same line as in the
two former groups, but are placed nearly at right angles to each
other. With this change in the direction of the main intestinal
segments the cæcum ceases to be a lateral appendage to the canal
and appears as a caudal prolongation of the colon beyond the
ileo-colic junction (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>III</i>). The type-form of this group
is encountered among the herbivorous Marsupialia, such as the
kangaroos and opossums. <a href="#Fig_350">Fig. 350</a> shows the ileo-colic junction
and cæcum in the rock wallaby, <i>Halmaturus derbyanus</i>, and <a href="#Fig_348">Fig.
348</a> the same structures in our common opossum, <i>Didelphis virginiana</i>.
The majority of the remaining mammalian forms depend
upon modifications of this type, either in the direction of
reduction of the cæcal apparatus, or of increased development
with concomitant structural changes of similar physiological import
in the proximal portion of the colon.</p>

<p>The following subdivisions of the general group may be established.</p>

<p>A. 1. The cæcum is long, markedly curved or uncinate, with
the crescentic medial margin turned toward the free border of the
terminal ileum. The entire pouch usually diminishes gradually
in caliber to its termination (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>III</i>, <i>A</i>, 1). This type is
encountered in a large group of new-world monkeys, including the
marmosets and howlers.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_440">Fig. 440</a> shows the structures in <i>Hapale jacchus</i>, one of the
marmosets, and <a href="#Fig_443">Fig. 443</a> illustrates the typical cæcum of this
form in <i>Ateles ater</i>, the black-handed spider monkey.</p>

<p>2. The cæcum and appendix of man and of the anthropoid apes
can be regarded as a reduction form of this type (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>III</i>, <i>A</i>, 2).<span class="pagenum" title="226"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>
Arrest of development of the terminal portion converts the distal
segment of the cæcal pouch into an appendix whose relation to
the apex of the funnel-shaped proximal segment or cæcum proper
is seen in its pure form in the human embryo (<a href="#Fig_512">Figs. 512</a> and <a href="#Fig_525">525</a>).
With the further development of the cæcum the sharper demarcation
between it and the appendix results (<a href="#Fig_517">Figs. 517</a> and <a href="#Fig_518">518</a>). The
displacement of the root of the appendix cephalad and to the left,
toward the lower margin of the ileo-colic junction, as it is usually
seen in adults, is due to the relatively greater growth of the right
terminal sacculation of the cæcum compared with the left (cf.
types of cæca, <a href="#Page_248">p.&nbsp;248</a>). Throughout these changes the initial crescentic
curve of the cæcum, turning its concavity upwards and to
the left, can be recognized by tracing the course of the longitudinal
colic muscular bands. The cæca and appendices of the anthropoid
apes present the same characters. The structures in the orang,
chimpanzee, gorilla and gibbon are shown in <a href="#Fig_455">Figs. 455</a>-<a href="#Fig_464">464</a>.</p>

<p>B. The Æluroid and Arctoid groups of the Carnivora and the
Pinnipedia constitute a very complete and instructive series illustrating
the gradual reduction of the cæcum from the capacious
pouch of the primitive type and its final complete elimination
from the organism (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>III</i>, <i>B</i>).</p>

<p>In <i>Hyæna</i> (<a href="#Fig_416">Fig. 416</a>), the large cæcum with undiminished caliber
of the terminal portion persists in its full development, as seen in
the Marsupials furnishing the fundamental type (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>III</i>).
The same type of cæcum is found in the lion (<a href="#Fig_417">Fig. 417</a>), the only
true cat in which the cæcal apparatus has not undergone extensive
reduction. Phylogenetically the presence of a capacious and
uniform cæcal pouch in these two animals is exceedingly important
and indicates that this type of cæcum represents the ancestral
form common to the æluroid carnivore group, which, in the remaining
living representatives, has become reduced in response
to the influence which the character of the food has on the structure
of this portion of the intestinal canal. The two instances of
persistence of the primal type are all the more important as exceptions
to the rule which is otherwise universal throughout the group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="227"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span></p>

<p>1. The first example of this reduction (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>III</i>, <i>B</i>, 1) is
encountered in the Aard-Wolf, <i>Proteles lalandii</i>, a near relative of
hyæna (<a href="#Fig_406">Fig. 406</a>). The cæcum in this animal is considerably
shortened, although still of fairly large and uniform caliber.</p>

<p>A similar type of cæcal reduction is encountered in the Pinnipede
Carnivora. <a href="#Fig_396">Fig. 396</a> shows the ileo-colic junction and the
short blunt cæcum of the harbor seal, <i>Phoca vitulina</i>.</p>

<p>2. The cæcum of the typical Felidæ, other than the lion, is short
and the terminal portion much reduced in caliber, constituting
in many forms a species of pointed rudimentary appendix (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig.
465</a>, <i>III</i>, <i>B</i>, 2). <a href="#Fig_401">Fig. 401</a> represents the typical feline cæcum as
seen in the puma, <i>Felis concolor</i>. Among the smaller Æluroid
Carnivora related to the true cats, as the civets and ichneumons,
the terminal reduction of the short cæcum is still more marked,
as seen for example in <i>Herpestes griseus</i> (<a href="#Fig_404">Figs. 404</a> and <a href="#Fig_405">405</a>).</p>

<p>3. In the Arctoid group of Carnivora (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>III</i>, <i>B</i>, 3 and
4) the reduction of the cæcal apparatus has been carried to the
complete elimination of the pouch, restoring the primitive type
of a straight intestinal tube without diverticulum as encountered
above in some of the Edentates (<a href="#Fig_356">Figs. 356</a> and <a href="#Fig_357">357</a>).</p>

<p>In some forms allied to the true bears, such as <i>Procyon</i>, <i>Bassaris</i>,
<i>Cercoleptes</i>, <i>Taxidea</i> and <i>Nasua</i>, the ileo-colic junction is
marked externally by a slight constriction and internally by the
projection of an annular pylorus-like valve (<a href="#Fig_407">Figs. 407</a>-<a href="#Fig_409">409</a>). The
transition from the thin-walled ileum to the thick muscular walls
of the large intestine is abrupt. The latter is very short and
usually increases in caliber as it approaches the anal orifice. The
mucosa of the terminal ileum presents very commonly one or two
large oval areas of agminated follicles near the ileo-colic junction.
The mucous membrane of the large intestine is thrown into prominent
longitudinal folds. <a href="#Fig_408">Fig. 408</a> shows the intestine of the brown
coati, <i>Nasua rufa</i>, opened on each side of the ileo-colic transition.</p>

<p>In some of the Arctoidea, as <i>Procyon</i> and <i>Nasua</i>, the beginning
of the colon just beyond the ileo-colic valve is bowed out opposite
the mesenteric border indicating the original site of the<span class="pagenum" title="228"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
eliminated cæcum, and recalling the arrangement of the intestine
encountered above in <i>Arctopithecus</i> among the Edentates (<a href="#Fig_363">Figs.
363</a>, <a href="#Fig_407">407</a>, <a href="#Fig_412">412</a>, and <a href="#Fig_465">465</a>, <i>III</i>, <i>B</i>, 3). Moreover, in the same forms
rudimentary vascular and serous folds around the ileo-colic junction,
corresponding to similar structures found in connection with
a well-developed cæcal apparatus in other mammalia, point to the
former existence of a cæcum.</p>

<p>4. In the typical Ursidæ even these remnants and traces of a
cæcal pouch have disappeared and the intestinal canal preserves
a uniform caliber, without any differentiation of large and small
intestine (<a href="#Fig_414">Figs. 414</a> and <a href="#Fig_415">415</a>, <a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>III</i>, <i>B</i>, 4).</p>

<p>C. The last subdivision of the third main group contains forms
in which the large uniform pouch of the primal type appears
moderately reduced in length and sacculated, terminating either
in a blunt extremity or carrying a distal constricted and rudimentary
segment as an appendage.</p>

<p>1. The first of these types is encountered in the Old World cynomorphous
monkeys. In all of these animals the cæcal pouch is
wide but comparatively short, of nearly uniform caliber and sacculated
like the rest of the colon, of which it forms the direct caudal
continuation (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>III</i>, <i>C</i>, 1). The terminal portion of the
pouch is usually blunt, globular and rounded (<a href="#Fig_428">Figs. 428</a>, <a href="#Fig_430">430</a> and
<a href="#Fig_431">431</a>), in a comparatively small number of forms slightly pointed
(<a href="#Fig_427">Figs. 427</a> and <a href="#Fig_437">437</a>).</p>

<p>2. In the second group the terminal reduced portion persists
either as a fairly distinct appendage, or in the form of a tapering
pointed extremity into which the cæcal pouch proper is continued
(<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>III</i>, <i>C</i>, 2). This type is encountered in certain non-ruminant
Ungulates. An example of the first condition is furnished
by the cæcal apparatus of the peccary (<i>Dicotyles torquatus</i>)
(<a href="#Fig_370">Fig. 370</a>), while the structures in <i>Tapirus americanus</i> (<a href="#Fig_377">Fig. 377</a>)
illustrate the second form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="229"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span></p>

<p class="center"><b>IV. Cæcal Apparatus Combined with Structural Modifications of the
Proximal Colon of Similar Physiological Significance.
(<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, IV.)</b></p>

<p>The fourth general mammalian group comprises forms in
which the cæcal pouch is large, with or without terminal appendage,
while in addition the large intestine develops structural
modifications which possess the general functional significance of
the cæcal apparatus. This highly developed and complicated
structure of the alimentary canal indicates that the habitual food
of these animals is bulky and difficult of digestion. Accordingly
we find the group composed in main of the majority of the Ungulates
and Rodents (with the exception of <i>Myoxus</i>), forms in which
the diet under natural conditions is purely herbivorous. Other
mammalian orders, however, also furnish representatives of this
type of cæcal apparatus, the conditions as regards character and
quantity of food habitually taken corresponding to those encountered
among the Ungulates and Rodents. Thus the <i>Phalangers</i>
among Marsupials (<a href="#Fig_352">Fig. 352</a>), <i>Galeopithecus</i> (<a href="#Fig_419">Fig. 419</a>) as an
exceptional form among the Insectivora, and certain lemurs
among Primates (<a href="#Fig_420">Figs. 420</a>-<a href="#Fig_425">425</a>) present examples of a highly
developed and specialized type of cæcal apparatus.</p>

<p>The intestinal tract of these forms must therefore be considered
from two points of view:</p>

<p>I. The cæcum proper.</p>

<p>II. The analogous structural modifications of the proximal segment
of the colon.</p>


<p class="center"><b>I. CÆCUM PROPER.</b></p>

<p>The pouch of the Ungulates and Rodents, taking these forms as
the typical representatives of the entire group, is usually of very
large size compared with the rest of the alimentary canal. Two
types are found:</p>

<p>1. Large capacious smooth cæcal pouch of uniform caliber
(<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>IV</i>, 2). This form is met with in the Muridæ among
Rodents and is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_393">Fig. 393</a> showing the cæcum of <i>Mus<span class="pagenum" title="230"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span>
decumanus</i>, var. <i>albinus</i>, the white rat. <a href="#Fig_392">Fig. 392</a> represents the
entire alimentary canal of the meadow mouse, <i>Arvicola pennsylvanicus</i>,
and indicates the proportion which the cæcal apparatus
bears to the remainder of the intestinal tract. The typical cæcum
of the Ungulates is shown in <a href="#Fig_371">Fig. 371</a>, taken from <i>Capra ægagrus</i>,
the bezoar goat, and in <a href="#Fig_372">Fig. 372</a>, taken from a preparation of
<i>Boselaphus tragocamelus</i>, the Nilghai.</p>

<p>2. The cæcal pouch is large, markedly crescentic in shape, sacculated,
or provided in the interior with a more or less complete
spiral valve, and reduced in caliber in the terminal segment,
forming at times a pointed appendix (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>IV</i>, 3). This form
is encountered typically among certain Rodents, as in <i>Castor fiber</i>,
the beaver (<a href="#Fig_381">Figs. 381</a> and <a href="#Fig_382">382</a>), and <i>Erethizon dorsatus</i>, the Canadian
porcupine (<a href="#Fig_383">Figs. 383</a> and <a href="#Fig_384">384</a>), but is not confined to this order.
Thus cæca of very similar structure are found among the Marsupials,
as in <i>Phascolarctos</i> and <i>Cuscus</i> (<a href="#Fig_352">Fig. 352</a>). In some of these
forms the terminal reduction of the cæcum is very marked, resulting
in a long narrow segment of the pouch tapering to a sharp point.
It is significant to note in this connection that in one member of
the marsupial order, the wombat (<i>Phascolomys</i>), this tendency to
terminal reduction of the pouch has led to the development of a
cæcum and appendix identical in structure and arrangement with
the corresponding parts of man and the anthropoid apes (<a href="#Fig_354">Fig.
354</a>). This is merely another illustration of the fact, evidenced
throughout the entire vertebrate series, that a primal type-form of
cæcal apparatus, in responding to the conditions which influence
the development of structural modifications, will produce identical
specific types in animals otherwise widely separated in the zoölogical
series.</p>

<p>Thus again the form of cæcum under discussion, found in
many Rodents and certain Marsupials, is encountered in the only
Insectivore possessing a cæcum (<i>Galeopithecus</i>) (<a href="#Fig_419">Fig. 419</a>), and in
several <i>Lemuroidea</i> among Primates (<a href="#Fig_420">Figs. 420</a>-<a href="#Fig_425">425</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="231"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></span></p>
<p class="center"><b>II. Structural Modifications of the Proximal Segment of the Colon
Analogous in Their Functional Significance
to the Cæcal Apparatus.</b></p>

<p>In these forms, in addition to the cæcal apparatus proper, certain
accessory structural modifications of the adjacent large intestine
are developed which possess the physiological significance of the
cæcal apparatus in general, since they serve to increase the extent
of the intestinal mucous surface and to prolong the period during
which the contents of the canal are retained for elaboration and
absorption. These modifications, which appear most fully developed
in certain Rodents and Ungulates, are of two kinds.</p>

<p>1. The development of the colic mucous membrane in the
form of a projecting fold or valve usually surrounding the lumen
spirally (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>IV</i>, 1). The significance and phylogeny of this
spiral fold has been considered above (cf. <a href="#Page_193">p.&nbsp;193</a>). Functionally
this reduplication must be regarded as in general equivalent
to the cæcal apparatus proper, in producing an increased surface
for secretion and absorption and in retarding the movement of
intestinal contents. The cæcal pouch evidently acts as a reservoir
in which partly digested substances, mixed with the secretions of
the small intestine, are retained while the slow processes of digestion
and absorption, already inaugurated in the antecedent segment
of the canal, are completed. It is reasonable to suppose
that the system of projecting mucous folds and reduplications
encountered in the colon beyond the cæcum have a similar physiological
import. Moreover, in certain forms the cæcum itself is
provided with a similar spiral mucous fold, as in the instances
already mentioned of <i>Lepus</i> among mammalia (<a href="#Fig_381">Fig. 381</a>) and of the
Ostrich among birds (<a href="#Fig_341">Fig. 341</a>). We have seen above (cf. <a href="#Page_193">p.&nbsp;193</a>)
that the spiral intestinal valve is encountered very early in the
vertebrate series, in forms in which the alimentary canal is but
slightly, or not at all differentiated, short and straight in its
course. In these forms the evident purpose of the spiral fold is to
retard the movement of the intestinal contents and to increase the
area of the secretory and absorbing surface. As a structural mod<span class="pagenum" title="232"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span>ification
possessing this character we saw the fold in the Cyclostomata,
Selachians and Dipn&oelig;ans (<a href="#Fig_310">Figs. 310</a>, <a href="#Fig_466">466</a>, <a href="#Fig_467">467</a> and <a href="#Fig_468">468</a>) and
in certain Ophidians (<i>Python</i> and <i>Anaconda</i>, <a href="#Fig_331">Figs. 331</a> and <a href="#Fig_469">469</a>).
Among Mammals it is found in certain Rodentia in two forms:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In some of the Muridæ, as <i>Arvicola</i> (<a href="#Fig_394">Fig. 394</a>), the mucous
membrane of the large globular cæcal pouch is smooth, but the
proximal segment of the colon, immediately beyond the ileo-colic
junction, develops the spiral fold (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>IV</i>, 2).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In other forms, as in the hares (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>IV</i>, 3), the greater
part of the cæcum carries a typical spiral fold, continued up to the
root of the terminal appendage (<a href="#Fig_388">Fig. 388</a>), in which segment the
mucous membrane is devoid of folds, but studded thickly with
lymphoid follicles. Beyond the cæcum proper the spiral fold is
continued in the opposite direction into the proximal segment of
the colon, which is large and capacious and evidently shares both
the physiological and morphological characters of the cæcum
proper, forming so to speak an accessory cæcal chamber. Beyond
what we thus might term the cæcal division of the colon the large
intestine becomes reduced in caliber, and the previously continuous
spiral fold becomes broken up into separate semilunar haustral
plicæ, corresponding to the superficial constrictions between
the colic cells. In structure this distal segment of the rabbit colon
closely resembles the human large intestine (<a href="#Fig_474">Fig. 474</a>).</p>

<p>One of the most marked examples of this secondary modification
of the colon is presented by the intestinal canal of another
Rodent, <i>Lagomys pusillus</i> (<a href="#Fig_391">Fig. 391</a>).</p>

<p>The cæcum of this animal is long, curved, provided with a well-developed
spiral fold. The terminal segment of the pouch is reduced
to an appendix, with smooth mucosa containing adenoid
tissue, as in the rabbit. A second adenoid appendix, representing
the globular saccus lymphaticus of the rabbit, is derived from the
cæcum at the ileo-colic junction. The first segment of the colon
beyond the ileo-colic junction is dilated and sacculated, the cæcal
mucous fold being prolonged into it. This is succeeded by a narrow
smooth-walled second segment. The third division of the
<span class="pagenum" title="233"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a></span>colon is again dilated and sacculated, followed by a short fourth
smooth-walled section. A fifth stretch is again provided with
colic cells, beyond which the terminal segment continues of
uniform caliber and with smooth walls to the vent. The colon
therefore presents three distinct sacculated portions whose structural
modifications suggest that they function in the same sense
as the cæcal pouch proper. In man and in other Primates the
crescentic colic plicæ are disposed in a more or less evident spiral
manner around the axis of the intestine, and it is not difficult to
recognize in them the modified remnants of the typical spiral
valve of lower forms. On the other hand, in conformity with the
general reduction of the cæcal apparatus, the mucous membrane
of the large intestine in Carnivora is smooth and devoid of any
trace of the spiral fold (<a href="#Fig_475">Fig. 475</a>).</p>

<p>2. The second structural modification of the large intestine,
associated in functional significance with the cæcal apparatus, depends
upon the increase in the length of the proximal segment of
the colon beyond the ileo-colic junction and the twisting or coiling
of this segment in a more or less complicated definite manner, usually
in the form of a spiral, the individual turns of the coil being
held in place by the peritoneal connections. The proximal colon
thus modified is admirably adapted to retard the movement of
contents not yet completely digested and to increase the absorbing
surface of the intestine, and hence is functionally allied to
the cæcal apparatus.</p>

<p>This colic modification is found in its highest degree of development
in the ruminant Ungulates, whose cæcal pouch proper is
also enormously developed. In these animals the colon immediately
beyond the ileo-cæcal junction is arranged in the form
of a double spiral, the afferent (cæcal) and efferent (colic) tubes
alternating, and continuous with each other in the center of the
coil (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>, <i>IV</i>, 5). Examples of this type of spiral colon are
shown in <a href="#Fig_373">Fig. 373</a> (<i>Bos indicus</i>), <a href="#Fig_374">Fig. 374</a> (<i>Cervus sika</i>), <a href="#Fig_375">Fig. 375</a>
(<i>Ovis aries</i>), <a href="#Fig_376">Fig. 376</a> (<i>Oryx leucoryx</i>). Ontogenetically the complicated
spiral colon of the ruminants starts as a simple loop of<span class="pagenum" title="234"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></span>
the proximal colon, which, with the further rapid growth of this
segment of the intestine, is bent to produce the turns of the coil
as shown in the schematic Figs. 480-482. Phylogenetically the
same gradual development can be traced in the vertebrate series.
Perhaps the earliest tendency to structurally modify the intestine
in the direction named is found in the manner in which the intestinal
coils are bound together by the subperitoneal arachnoid
in many Ophidians (<a href="#Fig_331">Fig. 331</a>). Further in the Manidæ among the
Edentates there is no cæcal pouch, but the intestine at the ileo-colic
junction is twisted into a figure 8 and held in this position
by the peritoneal connections (<a href="#Fig_362">Figs. 362</a> and <a href="#Fig_465">465</a>, <i>IV</i>, 4). In
certain Marsupials with well-developed cæcal pouches, such as
<i>Phascolarctos</i> and the Vulpine Phalangers (<a href="#Fig_351">Figs. 351</a> and <a href="#Fig_352">352</a>),
the colon immediately beyond the ileo-colic entrance is sacculated
and bent in the form of a short loop. In the tapir
(<a href="#Fig_377">Fig. 377</a>), the proximal segment of the colon forms a simple
loop, whose afferent and efferent limbs are closely bound together.
The arrangement of the large intestine in this animal illustrates
the early embryonal stage in the development of the complete
ruminant spiral coil (cf. <a href="#Figs_480-482">Fig. 480</a>).</p>

<p>The condition encountered in some Rodents presents a more
advanced stage. Thus the large intestine in the agouti (<i>Dasyprocta
agouti</i>), shows the development of the spiral coil advanced
as far as the second turn of the original loop (<a href="#Fig_389">Figs. 389</a> and <a href="#Fig_390">390</a>).
It is readily seen that continued growth of this segment of the
intestine leads to the formation of the complete colic spiral as
found in the typical Ungulates.</p>

<p>The same arrangement of the large intestine obtains in certain
Lemurs among the Primates. Thus the proximal colon of the
Slow Lemur (<i>Nycticebus tardigradus</i>) is seen in <a href="#Fig_421">Figs. 421</a> and
<a href="#Fig_422">422</a> to present a typical spiral coil, and similar conditions are
encountered in other members of the suborder.</p>

</div>

<p>We have left for our final consideration the aberrant and unique
mammalian type found in <i>Hyrax</i> (<a href="#Fig_378">Fig. 378</a>). In this remarkable<span class="pagenum" title="235"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>
little animal the large intestine develops a typical mammalian
sacculated cæcum at the ileo-colic junction, and in addition is
provided further on with two symmetrical pointed lateral colic
cæca of large size. It is quite true that this arrangement is
unique among Mammalia, confined entirely to the members of
the suborder formed by the single family of <i>Hyrax</i>, and that no
strictly analogous disposition of the alimentary canal is encountered
in the entire vertebrate series. Yet these aberrant structures
are possibly capable of explanation, in regard to the method of
their development, by reference to the cæcal apparatus of certain
phytophagous saurians, as <i>Iguana</i> and <i>Cyclura</i>. In these forms
(<a href="#Fig_326">Fig. 326</a>-<a href="#Fig_330">330</a>) the small intestine enters the colon somewhat asymmetrically,
the opening being guarded by a well developed annular
valve.</p>

<p>The proximal segment of the large intestine forms an extensive
sacculated pouch. If this is opened (<a href="#Fig_328">Figs. 328</a>-<a href="#Fig_330">330</a>) it is seen
that the small intestine leads into a compartment which is separated
from the remainder of the pouch by a valvular diaphragm
with central circular opening. Beyond this primary compartment
the colic pouch is incompletely subdivided by a series of
gradually diminishing crescentic folds, corresponding to the external
constrictions between the sacculations. The entire pouch
gradually diminishes in caliber until it passes with a sharp angular
bend into the terminal portion of the endgut. This terminal
segment is differentiated from the elongated colic pouch by the
greater thickness of its muscular walls and by a slight annular
projecting fold in the interior. In considering the intestinal tract
of <i>Hyrax</i> it is conceivable that the unique condition presented by
this animal may be derived from some type conforming in general
structure to the reptilian arrangement of the parts just detailed,
as indicated in the schematic Figs. 483-485. The proximal typical
cæcal pouch of <i>Hyrax</i> would then correspond to the similar colic
pouch of <i>Iguana</i>. To explain the supplementary colic cæca it is
necessary to suppose that the transition of the colic pouch into the
terminal hindgut had become well differentiated, and that on each<span class="pagenum" title="236"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
side of this junction the colic tube had extended backwards,
resulting in the production of the supplementary bilateral cæcal
pouches of <i>Hyrax</i>.</p>

<h2>PART IV.</h2>

<h2>MORPHOLOGY OF THE HUMAN CÆCUM
AND VERMIFORM APPENDIX.</h2>


<p>Not only is the anatomy of this portion of the alimentary
tract of great interest in relation to the evolution of the human
structure, but in addition the pathological and surgical importance
of the region warrants a very careful study of the cæcum
and appendix. This is more especially the case since a number
of variations in the arrangement of the structures are encountered.
These departures from what we consider the normal human
type have an important bearing on the development and progress
of the pathological conditions prone to involve the appendix. We
may consider the subject under the following subdivisions:</p>


<p class="center"><b>I. DEVELOPMENT OF THE CÆCUM AND APPENDIX.</b></p>

<p>Much light is thrown on the adult anatomy of the parts and
on the origin of the variations observed by the study of their
embryonic history. In considering the factors which determine
the variations in the position, size, and shape of the appendix it
must be remembered that the rudimentary character of this
structure is responsible for many of the aberrant conditions
encountered.</p>

<p>As a part of the general cæcal pouch which persists in an early
developmental stage and which we can regard as destined for
further reduction and ultimate elimination in the course of evolution,
the appendix shares with other vestigial structures a wide
range of variation. Consequently the study of the development
of this portion of the alimentary tract enables us to gain a clearer
view of the primary arrangement of the structures and to trace
the causes which are active in determining the adult conditions
most frequently encountered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="238"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span></p>
<p>At the time when the umbilical loop of the intestine has
formed and has begun to protrude into the cavity of the umbilical
cord (fifth to sixth week), the first indication of the future
cæcum appears as a circumscribed thickening of the returning or
ascending limb of the intestinal loop a short distance from the
apex (Figs. 486-488). This rudiment indicates the derivation of
the future definite intestinal segments from the elements of the
loop. The descending limb, apex (site of embryonic vitelline
duct, Meckel&rsquo;s diverticulum of adult) and a short succeeding portion
of the ascending limb furnish the ileum and jejunum. The
rest of the ascending limb develops into cæcum and appendix, ascending
and transverse colon. The increase in the length of the intestine
is not uniform. The formation of convolutions begins in
the seventh week in the apex and subsequently in the descending
limb. By the eighth week a considerable number of jejuno-ileal
coils have resulted from the growth in length of these parts of the
original umbilical loop, while the growth of the segment which
furnishes the colon is at this time still inconsiderable (<a href="#Figs_488-492">Fig. 489</a>).
In the meanwhile the thickening of the tube which forms the
first rudiment of the cæcum has developed into a small sac-like
enlargement of the gut, budding from the left and dorsal aspect
of the ascending limb, crescentic in shape, turning its concavity
toward the parent tube. In the majority of instances examined
the small outgrowth is packed closely between the incipient ileal
convolutions, lying under cover of the more prominent bulging
coils of the umbilical protrusion, between them and a single coil
of larger arc situated dorsally and belonging to the jejunal or
proximal portion of the small intestine (Fig. 490). <a href="#Fig_497">Fig. 497</a>,
taken from an embryo of 11&nbsp;mm. cervico-coccygeal length, represents
this stage in the development of the umbilical loop. The
arrangement of the cæcum which we can assume as the typical
condition at this stage and which determines in part the subsequent
final arrangement of the structures, is illustrated by this
relation of the cæcal bud to the surrounding incipient convolutions
of the small intestine, with the larger part of these coils<span class="pagenum" title="239"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span>
situated ventrad of the cæcum and only a single coil of larger
curve placed dorsally; the cæcal pouch, derived from the ascending
limb of the umbilical loop, is situated between these two
divisions, turning its concave border to the right and embracing
the parent tube. At the time when the human cæcum first appears
as a distinct structure it forms a small conical pouch with
blunt extremity whose shape is well illustrated by the cæcum of
some of the new-world monkeys, as <i>Mycetes fuscus</i>, the brown howler
monkey (<a href="#Fig_449">Figs. 449</a> and <a href="#Fig_450">450</a>). The outgrowth develops rapidly in
length and very soon assumes a distinct crescentic shape, gradually
tapering toward the extremity, a type which is found reproduced
in the cæcum of <i>Ateles ater</i>, the black-handed spider
monkey (<a href="#Fig_443">Fig. 443</a>). There is as yet no constriction or demarcation
separating the distal segment (future appendix) from the
proximal part (cæcum proper) but the entire pouch gradually
narrows funnel-like to its termination.</p>

<p class="center"><b>II. CHANGES IN THE POSITION OF THE CÆCUM AND APPENDIX
DURING NORMAL DEVELOPMENT, DEPENDING
UPON THE ROTATION OF THE INTESTINE
AND THE SUBSEQUENT DESCENT
OF THE CÆCUM.</b></p>

<p>The primary cause leading to the rotation of the intestinal
canal and inaugurating the successive stages which produce the
adult disposition of the tube is to be found in the rapid increase
in length of the small intestine. Numerous convolutions of this
tube succeed to the few primary coils noted in the first stages.
This condition is illustrated in Fig. 498, taken from an embryo
of 4.4&nbsp;cm. cervico-coccygeal measure, and the arrangement of the
intestine is indicated in schema, <a href="#Figs_488-492">Fig. 491</a>. The cæcum is found
nearly in the median line imbedded among the surrounding coils
of the small intestine, which by their rapid increase have pushed
the pouch cephalad nearly into contact with the caudal surface
of the liver.</p>

<p>Three main divisions of the convolutions of the small intestine
can be made out, slightly separated from each other in the figure<span class="pagenum" title="240"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span>
to exhibit the cæcum between them. The proximal (jejunal) set
of these convolutions occupy the upper and left part of the abdominal
cavity. They are the product of the single larger coil
which in the earlier stage (Fig. 497, schema <a href="#Figs_488-492">Fig. 490</a>) appeared
dorsad of the cæcal diverticulum. The distal (ileal) division of
small intestinal convolutions has become greatly augmented and
lies to the right of the cæcum. The concavity of the pouch is
still, as in the earlier stages, directed to the right and the
entrance of ileum into colon takes place from right to left.
The caudal part of the abdominal cavity is occupied by an intermediate
set of transition convolutions which join the proximal
and distal divisions. In the two stages just described (Figs.
497 and 498, Schema <a href="#Figs_488-492">Figs. 490</a> and <a href="#Figs_488-492">491</a>), the initial step in
the intestinal rotation has been taken, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the beginning of the
colon has been displaced cephalad from its original position in
the caudal and left part of the abdominal cavity by the pressure
of the rapidly growing coils of the small intestine and now
lies transversely ventrad of the duodenum, having crossed the
duodeno-colic neck or isthmus of the primitive umbilical loop
(cf. <a href="#Fig_487">Fig. 487</a>, <i>C</i>).</p>

<p>At first the distal coils of the small intestine occupy a position
<i>behind</i> as well as to the right of the cæcum, forming a dorsal retro-cæcal
division connected by intermediate convolutions with the
ventral division occupying the lower and left portion of the
abdominal cavity. The apex of the cæcum is frequently imbedded
among these terminal coils of the ileum. With the continued
growth of the small intestines a further displacement of the cæcum
cephalad and to the right takes place, while at the same time the
terminal ileal coils pass downwards and to the left, from a retro-cæcal
into a subcæcal position, thus permitting a direct apposition
of the cæcum to the dorsal parietal (prerenal) peritoneum.
The last steps in this process of withdrawal of the original voluminous
dorsal (retro-cæcal) division of ileal convolutions are well
seen in the preparation shown in Fig. 499, taken from an embryo
of 6.7&nbsp;cm. vertex-coccygeal measure, and corresponding to the<span class="pagenum" title="241"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span>
schematic stages represented in <a href="#Figs_488-492">Figs. 490</a> and <a href="#Figs_488-492">491</a>. The cæcum
in this preparation has not yet completed its rotation and still
turns its concavity upwards and to the right, with the apex
imbedded among the terminal convolutions of the ileum.</p>

<p>The ileo-cæcal junction takes place from right to left in a downward
direction. Nearly the entire mass of the small intestine is
situated below and to the left of cæcum and colon, but a terminal
ileal coil still occupies, although evidently in the process of withdrawal,
the retro-cæcal position, separating the cæcum from direct
contact with the dorsal parietal peritoneum. The withdrawal of
this terminal coil of the small intestine is accompanied, or immediately
followed, by a further turn of the colon cephalad and to
the right, which brings it into contact with the caudal surface of
the liver and completes the rotation, producing a change in the
relative positions of the terminal ileal coils and the cæcum. In
the stages illustrated in Figs. 498 and 499 and shown schematically
in <a href="#Figs_488-492">Figs. 490</a> and <a href="#Figs_488-492">491</a>, the terminal coils of the ileum pass
from right to left behind the cæcum to enter the colon, and the
concavity of the cæcal pouch is directed upwards and to the right.
After the final rotation has occurred (schema, <a href="#Figs_488-492">Fig. 492</a>) the ileum
enters the large intestine from the left and from below, and the
concave border of the cæcum is directed caudad and to the left.
This change in relative position has been accomplished by a revolution
of the colon and cæcum through an arc of 180° around its
own long axis carrying the cæcum above and behind the small
intestine and bringing it into contact with the dorsal prerenal
parietal peritoneum. At the same time the terminal coils of the
ileum turn downwards and to the left. If this final step in the
rotation of the large intestine fails to occur, with otherwise
normal development of the parts, the ileum will persist in
entering the large intestine from right to left after the cæcum
has obtained its final lodgment in the right iliac fossa. We
have had occasion to refer previously to the significance of
these instances of partially arrested development (cf. <a href="#Page_61">p.&nbsp;61</a>, <a href="#Fig_123">Figs.
123</a>, <a href="#Fig_127">127</a> and <a href="#Fig_128">128</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="242"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span></p>

<p>In Figs. 500 and 501, taken from an embryo of 4.9&nbsp;cm. vertex-coccygeal
measure, the final rotation of the cæcum from the position
occupied in <a href="#Fig_498">Fig. 498</a> has occurred and the concavity of the
pouch is directed caudad and towards the left. At the same time
the escape of the terminal ileal coils from behind the cæcum and
beginning of the colon has not yet taken place and hence the
colon is still kept by these coils from direct opposition to the
dorsal prerenal parietal peritoneum. The condition presented by
this preparation can be schematically indicated by <a href="#Figs_488-492">Figs. 492</a> and
<a href="#Figs_488-492">493</a>. The rotation has carried the beginning of the colon (Fig.
500), with the cæcal bud and appendix curved on itself and turning
its concavity to the left, into the subhepatic position. The
greater part of the small intestinal coils lie now below and to the
left of the cæcum, but the terminal ileal convolutions (Fig. 500)
still occupy a retro-cæcal position, separating the pouch and the
colon from the dorsal parietal peritoneum. In Fig. 501 the right
lateral view of the same embryo is shown with the cæcum and
colon depressed and turned to the left. The termination of the
ileum reaches the ileo-colic junction by passing behind the cæcum,
and the immediately adjacent ileal coils are still retro-cæcal, intervening
between the pouch and the dorsal parietal peritoneum.</p>

<p>In the next succeeding stage (schema, <a href="#Figs_493-496">Fig. 494</a>) these coils of
the ileum turn downward and to the left so as to lie below and
mesad to the cæcum and colon, thus permitting the direct apposition
of the large intestine to the parietal prerenal peritoneum.
The terminal ileum now passes from below and to the left upwards
and to the right to its junction with the colon. This freeing
of the dorsal surface of cæcum and colon from contact with
the coils of the small intestines, and the consequent direct apposition
of the same to the dorsal parietal peritoneum influences to
a great extent the subsequent arrangement of the parts, because
it affords the conditions necessary to the fixation of the colon and
mesocolon by adhesion to the parietal peritoneum (cf. <a href="#Page_81">p.&nbsp;81</a>).</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_499">Fig. 499</a>, taken from an embryo of 6.7&nbsp;cm. vertex-coccygeal
measure, illustrates this stage, which is encountered in the ma<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>jority
of instances and during which the retro-cæcal coils of the
terminal ileum are withdrawn (schema, <a href="#Figs_493-496">Fig. 493</a>). The convolutions
of the small intestine have greatly increased in size and
number. The retro-cæcal ileal coils, compared with Fig. 500,
have shifted their position caudad and to the left, so as to lie
below and ventrad of the beginning of the colon. Only a single
coil remains behind the cæcum and appendix, intervening between
these structures and the ventral surface of the right kidney,
and this coil is in the process of withdrawal from the dorsal
position as indicated by the superficial and short course of the
coil which connects it with the remaining ventral convolutions.
As soon as the withdrawal of this single remaining dorsal coil
is completed the entire mass of the small intestines will occupy
a position ventrad, caudad and to the left of the cæcum and colon
(<a href="#Figs_493-496">Fig. 494</a>), which will then rest directly against the dorsal parietal
peritoneum investing the ventral surface of the right kidney.</p>

</div>

<p>This stage is illustrated in Fig. 502, taken from an embryo of
6.6&nbsp;cm. vertex-coccygeal measure. The cæcum and appendix
here occupy the subhepatic position, well to the right of the median
line and in the background of the abdominal cavity. The
terminal retro-cæcal ileal coils of the embryo shown in Figs. 500
and 501 have descended caudad and to the left, thus freeing the
dorsal surface of cæcum and colon and permitting direct contact
with the prerenal parietal peritoneum.</p>

<p>In the succeeding stages the cæcum gradually descends along
the background of the right lumbar region from the subhepatic
position to the right iliac fossa, producing by this descent the
ascending colon as a distinct segment of the large intestine.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in the stage shown in Fig. 502 (schema,
<a href="#Figs_493-496">Fig. 494</a>) the large intestine passes from the cæcum to the splenic
flexure transversely from right to left across the upper part of the
abdominal cavity, caudad and ventrad of the stomach and cephalad
of the coils of the small intestine.</p>

<p>In the following stages the disproportionately large size of the
embryonic liver compels the colon, as the cæcum descends, to<span class="pagenum" title="244"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span>
assume an oblique position. When the cæcal descent is completed
the colon traverses the abdominal cavity in contact with the
caudal surface of the liver passing from the right iliac fossa
obliquely cephalad and to the left to the splenic flexure where it
becomes continuous with the descending colon, which segment
has early assumed its definite position in the background of the
abdominal cavity on the left side (<a href="#Figs_493-496">Fig. 495</a>). This oblique position
of the colon is seen in Figs. 503 and 504. During this stage
the increase in the length of the colon may lead to the arrangement
seen in <a href="#Fig_505">Fig. 505</a>, where the future transverse segment of the
large intestine is bent caudad in form of an arch whose summit
extends nearly to the pelvis. This condition at times persists in
the adult, in cases of unusually long large intestine, and recalls
the normal arrangement found in many of the cynomorphous
monkeys in whom the transverse colon forms an extensive V-or
U-shaped loop, with the apex directed caudad toward the pubic
symphysis (<a href="#Fig_506">Fig. 506</a>). In other instances in the human f&oelig;tus
this part of the large intestine is thrown into a number of shorter
irregular coils (<a href="#Fig_507">Fig. 507</a>).</p>

<p>Normally, however, in the process of further development and
with the relative decrease in the size of the liver, the hepatic

<p class="center"><b>III. VARIATIONS OF ADULT CÆCUM AND APPENDIX.</b></p>

<p>The study of the variations of the adult cæcum and appendix
involves the consideration of the following points:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Shape of cæcum and origin of appendix. (<i>Type of adult
cæcum.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Position, direction and peritoneal relations of the appendix.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Arrangement of the vascular and serous ileo-cæcal folds.</p>

<p>The peculiarities encountered in any individual case usually
depend upon the combination of all three of these factors, which<span class="pagenum" title="245"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></span>
together influence and determine the arrangement of the structures
in the adult. Hence the examination of each case should
be made with reference to these three points, which we will now
consider in detail.</p>


<p class="center"><b>A. SHAPE OF CÆCUM AND ORIGIN OF APPENDIX. TYPES
AND VARIATIONS OF ADULT CÆCUM AND APPENDIX.</b></p>

<p>The various forms of the adult cæcum are all derived by modifications
from the f&oelig;tal type of the pouch.</p>

<p>In the embryo the cæcum is funnel-shaped, narrowing gradually
and symmetrically in caliber to the root of the appendix,
at which point the three colic tænia or longitudinal muscular
bands of the large intestine meet. The appendix arises from the
apex of the funnel, the lateral walls of which are equally and
symmetrically developed. The entire pouch is of a crescentic
shape, the concavity of the curve turned to the left and directed
toward the caudal margin of the terminal ileum. Two subdivisions
of the f&oelig;tal type are found:</p>

2. Reduced intermediate non-vascular fold.<br />
3. Ventral vascular fold.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>I. The crescentic curve of the cæcum is only slightly marked;
the appendix arises from the most pendent part of the pouch and
hangs downward (schema, Fig. 509, <i>I, a</i>).</p>

<p>This form, which is encountered only occasionally in the f&oelig;tus
and infant, is illustrated by the preparation shown in Fig. 510,
taken from a f&oelig;tus at term.</p>

<p>II. In the majority of cases the inherent crescentic shape of the
cæcal pouch is pronounced and carries the termination of the
funnel with the root of the appendix cephalad and to the left toward
the caudal margin of the ileo-colic junction (schema, Fig.
509, <i>II, a</i>).</p>

<p>At birth this typical arrangement of the cæcum frequently
places the pouch in a nearly transverse position, with the apex
and the root of the appendix turned to the left, in contact with,
or under cover of the terminal piece of the ileum at its junction
with the large intestine.</p>

<p>Figs. 513 and 514, also taken from the f&oelig;tus at term, show the
cæcum from the dorsal aspect and illustrate well the sharp character
of the curve which carries the apex of the pouch up and to
the left.</p>

<p>All the variations observed in the adult cæcum are derived
from these two f&oelig;tal types by a subsequent and usually asymmetrical
enlargement and dilatation of the pouch.</p>

<p>We can consider the derivatives of each form separately.</p>

<p>1. Further development leads to an enlargement of the cæcal
pouch and a sharper demarcation between the same and the appendix.
The resulting cæcum is symmetrical, with equally developed
lateral sacculi, between which the termination of the
longitudinal muscular bands and the root of the appendix is situated
(schema, <a href="#Fig_509">Fig. 509</a>, <i>I<sup>b</sup></i>).</p>

<p>In Figs. 515 and 516 two infantile cæca are shown which illustrate
this form. The narrow and pointed apex of the f&oelig;tal conical
cæcum is replaced by the capacious pouch which is differentiated
sharply from the appendix. Among the anthropoid apes
the same type is seen in the cæcum of the gibbon (<a href="#Fig_455">Figs. 455</a> and
<a href="#Fig_456">456</a>), and of the young chimpanzee shown in <a href="#Fig_460">Fig. 460</a>.</p>

<p>2. An increased development of the cæcal pouch in the adult
leads to the protrusion caudad of two symmetrical sacculations
on each side of the root of the appendix which appears between
them. The original apex of the cæcal pouch is still marked by
the implantation of the appendix and by the termination of the
longitudinal muscular bands, but the lowest level of the pouch is
found on each side of this point at the fundus of the secondary
lateral sacculi (schema, <a href="#Fig_509">Fig. 509</a>, <i>I<sup>c</sup></i>). Treves, to whom belongs
the credit of first accurately describing and classifying the forms
of the adult cæcum based on the development, found this type
in three of a series of 100 cases examined.</p>

<p>1. The general shape and trend of the f&oelig;tal cæcum is preserved.
The pouch turns sharply to the left, carrying the apex with the
root of the appendix upward toward the ileum, the appendix
itself being frequently placed under cover of the terminal coil of
the small intestine (schema, <a href="#Fig_509">Fig. 509</a>, <i>II<sup>b</sup></i>).</p>

<p>The apex of the cæcal pouch is either conical, narrowing gradually
toward the root of the appendix (Figs. 520 and 521), or
blunt and more sharply defined against the appendix (Fig. 522).

<p>The cæcum is frequently sharply bent on itself in making the
turn upward and to the left, resulting in a deep indentation of
the concave border and producing a corresponding projecting
fold in the interior of the pouch (Fig. 523). The ventral longitudinal
muscular band follows the crescentic sweep of the cæcum
to the root of the appendix.</p>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: There are no illustrations labelled 524a
and 525b, only those labelled 524 and 525.">Figs. 524<i>a</i> and 525<i>b</i></ins>,
representing the cæcum of a f&oelig;tus at term in the ventral and
dorsal view respectively, show very clearly the arrangement of the
f&oelig;tal pouch from which the adult type with sharp angular bend is
derived. This type of adult cæcum is found in certain of the anthropoid
apes.</p>

<p>In the orang (<a href="#Fig_458">Figs. 458</a> and <a href="#Fig_459">459</a>) the cæcum turns sharply upward
and to the left, gradually narrowing in caliber to the root
of the appendix which is coiled behind the termination of the
ileum.</p>

<p>The same type is seen in <a href="#Fig_462">Figs. 462</a> and <a href="#Fig_463">463</a>, taken from a preparation
of the adult chimpanzee. <a href="#Fig_463">Fig. 463</a> shows especially well
the sharp bend between the cæcum and colon by means of which
the apex of the pouch is carried cephalad behind the ileo-colic
junction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="248"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig_431">Fig. 431</a>, taken from another specimen of the same animal,
shows the characteristic crescentic curve of the cæcum and the
corresponding course of the longitudinal muscular band. The
apex of the pouch in this preparation is more rounded and
blunt.</p>

<p>The same blunt termination of the cæcum of this type, with a
corresponding sharper demarcation of the appendix, is seen in the
gorilla (<a href="#Fig_457">Fig. 457</a>) recalling the conditions found in certain instances
in the human subject (<a href="#Fig_522">Fig. 522</a>).</p>

<p>2. In by far the larger proportion of cases (ninety per cent. in
Treves&rsquo; series) the adult cæcum obtains its characteristic form by
an unequal development of the walls of the intestine. The right
segment between the ventral and dorso-lateral muscular bands
dilates, forming a sacculation which projects caudad and constitutes
the secondary caput coli, while the segment between the
lower border of the ileum and the original apex, marked by the
origin of the appendix, remains stationary or is further reduced.
This unequal development produces a relative displacement of
the root of the appendix upward and to the left toward the ileo-colic
junction.</p>

<p>In some cases the primitive crescentic curve of the cæcum, as
indicated by the direction of the ventral longitudinal muscular
band, is still perceptible.</p>

<p>The right wall of the f&oelig;tal cæcum, forming the most pendent
portion of the pouch, dilates uniformly and thus constitutes the
adult caput coli. The left wall appears as a small sacculation
separating the root of the appendix from the ileo-colic junction
(schema, <a href="#Fig_509">Fig. 509</a>, <i>II, c</i>). This type of the adult cæcum is illustrated
by the preparations shown in Figs. 526-528. In other
cases part of the right wall of the cæcum between the ventral and
dorso-lateral colic tænia, dilates abruptly forming a very prominent
rounded sacculation which carries the lowest part of the
pouch caudad in a sharper curve than in the preceding form as
indicated by its deviation from the direction of the longitudinal
muscular band (schema, <a href="#Fig_509">Fig. 509</a>, <i>II, d</i>).</p>

<p>3. Finally, in about four per cent. to five per cent., adult cæca,
the reduction of the wall to the left of the root of the appendix,
between this point and the ileo-colic junction, is complete. The
entire cæcal pouch is formed by the dilated right wall between
the ventral and dorsolateral muscular bands. The ventral band
terminates at the lower border of the ileo-colic junction, from
which the appendix appears to arise, indicating the original apex
of the f&oelig;tal cæcum (schema, <a href="#Fig_509">Fig. 509</a>, <i>II<sup>e</sup></i>).</p>

<p><b>III. Adult Cæca in Cases of Absence of the Appendix.</b>&mdash;A few instances
of congenital absence of the appendix have been observed.</p>

</div>

<p>A. v. Haller<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> describes the condition in the following words:
&ldquo;Defuisse visa est in homine appendicula, ut tuberculum minimum
superesset.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fr. Arnold,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> without describing any individual case, states that
&ldquo;very rarely the appendix is entirely wanting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>E. Zuckerkandl,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> reports having observed one case of absence
of the appendix.</p>

<p>J. D. Bryant,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> reports a case in which he operated for appendicitis
but found &ldquo;absolutely no appendix.&rdquo; &ldquo;The point of tenderness
was found to be a glandular growth located posterior to the
usual site of the appendix.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two instances of this variation are shown in Figs. 535 and 536,
taken from preparations in the Morphological Museum of Columbia
University. In both careful examination of the external
as well as of the mucous surface of the cæcum demonstrated the
entire absence of the appendix, and the subjects from which they<span class="pagenum" title="250"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a></span>
were obtained presented no scars or other evidences of operative
removal or of pathological processes. They are both, therefore,
authentic instances of complete congenital absence of the appendix,
not of so-called retro-peritoneal or hidden appendix.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>The two examples differ from each other in some details. In
the first case (Fig. 535, schema, <a href="#Fig_509">Fig. 509</a>, <i>III<sup>a</sup></i>) the cæcum is
rounded and globular. The ventral longitudinal muscular band
is vertical and continued to the lowest point of the pouch, which
greatly resembles the cæcum of a typical cynomorphous monkey.</p>

<p>In the second case (Fig. 536, schema, <a href="#Fig_509">Fig. 509</a>, <i>III<sup>b</sup></i>) the cæcum
turns upwards and to the left, terminating in a sharp point, to
which several lobes of epiploic fat are attached.</p>

<p>We must assume that in these cases the embryonic portion of
the cæcal bud was developed just sufficiently to yield the required
adult pouch with nothing to spare, so to speak, which
could remain rudimentary in the form of an appendix.</p>

<p>Instances of exceedingly rudimentary and reduced appendix
are also encountered.</p>

<p>In the case illustrated in Fig. 537 the appendix formed a small
conical elevation without distinct lumen, measuring only 0.5&nbsp;cm.
in length.</p>

</div>

<p><b>B. Position and Peritoneal Relations of the Appendix.</b>&mdash;Statistical
records of the position of the appendix indicate a wide range of
variation. In general the results obtained by different observers
show that certain positions of the appendix are encountered in a
sufficiently large percentage of the cases to enable us to adopt a
classification, but that a very extensive series of records are required
in order to determine even approximately the preponderant
relations of the appendix. The following are the most
frequently observed positions:</p>

<p>1. The appendix is directed upward, inward and to the left, the
terminal portion being frequently coiled under cover of the ileum
and mesentery. This position of the appendix is largely due to
the normal crescentic curve of the cæcum, which carries the apex
<span class="pagenum" title="251"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></span>of the pouch and the root of the appendix upward and to the
left. Its production is, moreover, favored by the tendency of
the adult cæcum to develop by dilatation of the ventral and right
wall at the expense of the left side of the pouch, thus relatively
shortening the interval between the origin of the appendix and
the ileo-colic junction.</p>

<p>Examples of this commonly encountered position of the
appendix are given in <a href="#Fig_512">Figs. 512</a>, <a href="#Fig_513">513</a>, <a href="#Fig_514">514</a>, <a href="#Fig_520">520</a>, <a href="#Fig_521">521</a>, <a href="#Fig_523">523</a> and
<a href="#Fig_526">526</a>.</p>

situated behind cæcum and ascending colon. The large intestine has a free peritoneal dorsal
surface, and the appendix is held in position by adhesion to the large intestine. (Columbia University,

</div>

<p>2. The appendix is erected vertically behind the cæcum and
ascending colon and closely attached to the dorsal wall of the
large intestine. In some instances the cæcum and colon, with
the adherent vertical appendix, possess a free serous dorsal surface,
not adherent to the parietal peritoneum (<a href="#Fig_529">Figs. 529</a>, <a href="#Fig_538">538</a>, <a href="#Fig_539">539</a>
and <a href="#Fig_540">540</a>). In other cases the ascending colon is fixed and the
greater part of the retro-colic appendix is buried in the connective
tissue which attaches the large intestine to the abdominal
parietes (<a href="#Fig_517">Fig. 517</a>). Even in these cases, however, the dorsal surface
of the cæcum and the root of the appendix retain their free
serous investment.</p>

<p>3. The proximal part of the appendix turns upward and to
the left in continuation of the cæcal curve, but the distal portion
is directed downward and inward, hanging over the brim of the
pelvis (<a href="#Fig_505">Figs. 505</a>, 541 and 542).</p>

<p>5. The position of the appendix is variant and abnormal, as
<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> placed to the right of cæcum and colon (Fig. 544) or turned
up ventrad of the ileo-colic junction (Fig. 545).</p>

<p>These variations in the position of the appendix and the resulting
peritoneal relations of the structure depend upon the following
factors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="252"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></span></p>

<p>1. The influence of peritoneal adhesions established during the
descent of the cæcum from the subhepatic position to the iliac
fossa.</p>

<p>2. The inherent curve of the cæcal pouch.</p>

<p>3. The subsequent alterations in the caliber of the intestine and
the unequal development of the pouch leading to the formation
of the types of adult cæca above considered.</p>

<p>In determining the causes which lead to the establishment of
any given position of the appendix all three of the factors above
enumerated must be taken into account, although their influence
is not exerted in every case to an equal degree.</p>

<p>We have seen that normally, after completed rotation of the
intestine, the cæcum with the appendix and the beginning of the
colon are lodged in the upper and right part of the abdomen,
below the liver and in contact with the prerenal parietal peritoneum
(schema, <a href="#Figs_493-496">Figs. 493</a>, <a href="#Fig_502">502</a>). During the subsequent stages
the cæcum descends into the right iliac fossa, thus producing the
ascending colon. It is immaterial whether this change in position
is regarded as an actual descent of the pouch over the ventral
surface of the right kidney, which seems more probable, or as a
growing away from the iliac region of the remainder of the abdominal
wall, with a concomitant relative reduction in the size of
the liver, producing a relatively lower position of the cæcum,
or as a combination of these processes. In either case during this
period the dorsal surface of the ascending colon and mesocolon
normally becomes adherent to the dorsal parietal peritoneum, connective
tissue developing between the opposed serous areas and
leading to the usual fixation of the ascending colon and obliteration
of the free ascending mesocolon. If this process of adhesion
is inaugurated at an early stage, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, before the descent of the
cæcum has been accomplished, it will act as a drag on the dorsal
surface of the colic tube during the subsequent change in position,
which carries the cæcum downward into the iliac fossa. This leads
to a backward bend of the cæcum and appendix which parts will
in the ventral view appear under cover of the protruding free<span class="pagenum" title="253"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span>
ventral and lateral walls of the colon. Hence in many late
embryos and f&oelig;tus at term the lowest point of the large intestine
in the right iliac fossa is formed by the proximal part of the
cæcum or by the adjacent segment of the colon, while the original
termination of the pouch, with the root of the appendix, is turned
backward and upward, and, as we have seen, by reason of the
inherent shape of the pouch, also to the left, carrying the beginning
of the appendix frequently behind the terminal ileum and
the ileo-colic junction.</p>

<p>Two of the more common positions of the appendix, viz., backwards,
upwards and inwards behind the ileo-colic junction, and
directly backward, erected vertically behind cæcum and colon,
can therefore in part be referred to the mechanical conditions obtaining
normally during the descent of the cæcum. Of course the
shape of the cæcal pouch and the later development of the adult
type of cæcum will modify this influence in individual cases. We
have seen that this early adhesion and the resulting effects on
the position of cæcum and appendix depend on the direct apposition
of the colic tube and mesocolon to the dorsal parietal peritoneum.
Any condition which will prevent or delay this apposition
will likewise perpetuate the original embryonal condition
of the tube, completely invested by peritoneum and with a free
mesocolon.</p>

<p>Such an element is found in the persistence of the dorsal set of
ileal convolutions in the original retro-cæcal position beyond the
usual period, as indicated in the schematic <a href="#Figs_488-492">Fig. 492</a>, <i>IV, a</i>. If
the turn downward and to the left of these coils is for any reason
delayed beyond the usual time the cæcal extremity of the colon
will descend from the subhepatic to the iliac position without
coming directly into contact with the dorsal parietal peritoneum,
and therefore without the usual peritoneal adhesion and obliteration
of the apposed serous surfaces. The cæcum under these conditions
descends without making the backward bend, and the
origin of the appendix is found at the lowest point of the pendent
funnel-shaped pouch, causing it finally to hang downward<span class="pagenum" title="254"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></span>
or downward and inward over the pelvic brim. The resulting
form of the cæcum and the position of the appendix is the one
above described as type <i>Ia</i>, <i>Ib</i> and <i>Ic</i> (<a href="#Fig_509">Fig. 509</a>).</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_510">Fig. 510</a> from a f&oelig;tus at term, and <a href="#Fig_515">Figs. 515</a> and <a href="#Fig_516">516</a> representing

<p>Fig. 546 exhibits the condition obtaining during the development
of this type in the more exceptional instances of delayed
apposition of the colon to the parietal peritoneum and of increased
development of the terminal ileal coils in the original
retro-cæcal position. In this embryo, measuring 6.5&nbsp;cm. in vertex-coccygeal
length, the development has progressed sufficiently to
establish a distinct transverse colon and to bring the cæcum and appendix
into the subhepatic position. But in place of lying in contact
with the dorsal parietal peritoneum, as in the embryo, shown in
<a href="#Fig_502">Fig. 502</a>, over the ventral surface of the right kidney, the increased
mass of the retro-cæcal ileal coils keeps the cæcum, already in
the process of descent, in contact with the ventral abdominal
wall. When the final rotation of the retro-cæcal small intestinal
coils downward and to the left occurs, placing the ileo-colic junction
(<i>C</i>) to the left of the large intestine (schema. <a href="#Figs_493-496">Fig. 494</a>), the
ascending colon and cæcum are not yet fixed by adhesion to the
dorsal parietal peritoneum, and the appendix will present downward
and to the left, affording the necessary conditions for the
establishment of the permanent pendent position of the tube or
causing the same to be directed downward and inward over the
brim of the pelvis.</p>

<p>In contrast with the preceding is the condition shown in Fig.
547, taken from an embryo of 5.9&nbsp;cm. vertex-coccygeal measure.
The transverse colon in this preparation has already begun to
assume an oblique position, passing down and to the right from
the splenic flexure. The cæcum and appendix are in contact
with the dorsal prerenal parietal peritoneum. The escape of the
dorsal set of ileal convolutions from the retro-cæcal position, by<span class="pagenum" title="255"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span>
rotation downwards and to the left, is accomplished. The cæcum
and appendix are placed in the position which they would have
occupied in the embryo shown in Fig. 546 if the dorsal ileal coils
had not prevented, in the latter preparation, the apposition of the
colon to the dorsal parietal peritoneum.</p>

<p>In considering the effect of these variant conditions on the adult
arrangement of the structures it is necessary to bear in mind the
second of the above-mentioned factors, namely, the inherent shape
of the cæcal pouch and appendix and the resulting direction of
its axis.</p>

<p>As previously stated the normal type of the human embryonal
cæcum is represented by the pouch of some of the new-world
monkeys, as <i>Ateles</i> (<a href="#Fig_443">Fig. 443</a>) or of certain lemurs, of which <i>Nycticebus</i>
(<a href="#Fig_420">Fig. 420</a>) furnishes an excellent example. The cæcum is
distinctly crescentic, turning its concave margin, after completed
intestinal rotation, upwards and to the left, toward the lower
margin of the ileum. The distal diminished segment of the
pouch in <i>Ateles</i> has already assumed the character of a cæcal appendage
in <i>Nycticebus</i> and becomes by further reduction the typical
appendix in man and the anthropoid apes, while the proximal
portion develops into the capacious sacculated cæcum proper.
Consequently the initial curve of the cæcum tends to carry the
root of the appendix upward and to the left toward the ileo-colic
junction. This curve of the pouch, combined with the mechanical
effects produced by the adhesion of the colon during the cæcal
descent, accounts for the frequency with which the cæcum in the
later months of f&oelig;tal life and at birth is found curved backward,
upward and to the left, placing the root of the appendix under
cover of the terminal ileal convolutions (Fig. 548). We have
seen that this disposition of the structures accounts for the preponderance
of that type of adult cæcum which results from the
further and unequal development and dilatation of the segment
of the pouch situated to the right of the origin of the appendix.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the three elements just considered, viz., the
effect of adhesion during the cæcal descent, the inherent shape<span class="pagenum" title="256"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span>
of the pouch and the unequal alterations in caliber in the development
of the adult type, we can at once take up the resulting
variations in the peritoneal relations of the adult cæcum and
appendix which have an important influence on the progress of
pathological processes in this region. It should be remembered
that in the following schematic figures the colon, cæcum and appendix
are represented in the profile view in a straight line,
without indicating the characteristic turn of the crescentic cæcal
pouch upwards and to the left.</p>

<p>Fig. 549 shows the arrangement in unimpeded cæcal descent
without adhesion of colon and mesocolon to the parietal peritoneum.
This disposition of the structures, if carried into adult
life, would produce the permanently free ascending colon and
mesocolon which we encountered exceptionally in the human
subject (cf. <a href="#Page_82">p.&nbsp;82</a>) and normally in certain of the cynomorphous
monkeys (<a href="#Page_83">p.&nbsp;83</a>). The ascending colon and mesocolon can,
under these conditions, be turned mesad, lifting them away from
the primary parietal peritoneum investing the ventral surface of
the right kidney. Cæcum and appendix have, of course, a complete
serous investment.</p>

<p>Normally, however, in the human subject, even if the obliteration
of the apposed serous surfaces and the resulting fixation of
the ascending colon has been delayed beyond the usual period, as
above indicated, adhesion takes place subsequently, involving the
dorsal surface of the ascending colon between the ileo-colic junction
and the hepatic flexure (schema, Fig. 550). The dorsal surface
of the cæcum usually retains its free serous surface in whole
or in greater part. The appendix is pendent, entirely invested
by peritoneum and hangs free in the abdominal cavity, directed
toward the pelvic brim, illustrating the effect of delayed fixation
of the colon on the position of the appendix.</p>

<p>Examples of this condition are not frequent, and are confined
almost exclusively to f&oelig;tal and juvenile subjects. Illustrations
are afforded by <a href="#Fig_515">Figs. 515</a> and <a href="#Fig_516">516</a>.</p>

<p>We have already noted (<a href="#Page_246">p.&nbsp;246</a>) the resulting f&oelig;tal type of
pendent cæcum (<a href="#Fig_510">Fig. 510</a>).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="257"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span></p>
<p>More commonly colic adhesion before the cæcum obtains its
final iliac position results in imparting a backward turn to the
pouch, leading to the peritoneal disposition shown in schema, <a href="#Fig_551">Fig.
551</a>, in which the root of the appendix is involved in the area
of obliteration, while the terminal segment remains free. An
example of this condition is furnished by the embryo shown in
<a href="#Fig_508">Fig. 508</a> (10.7&nbsp;cm. vertex-coccygeal measure). The colon is
already segmented into an ascending, transverse and descending
portion. The cæcum is retroverted and its apex with the appendix
is placed under cover of the terminal ileum which enters
the large intestine in the direction from below upward and to the
right. In the side-figure the divided end of the ileum is displaced
upward to show cæcum and appendix and their relation to the
ileal mesentery.</p>

<p>The disposition of the structures illustrated by this example
probably depends upon delayed adhesion of the colic embryonal
tube to the dorsal parietal peritoneum. The cæcum and appendix
appear to have descended freely until the final position in the
right iliac fossa has been nearly attained, adhesion and fixation
of the colon taking place just before the descent is completed, and
thus producing the backward turn of the cæcal end of the tube.
Further development of the cæcum to form the adult caput coli
in these cases leads to the unequal and exaggerated expansion of
the ventral and lateral walls of the pouch, as compared with the
fixed and adherent dorsal wall. The former are distended and
pushed downwards, producing a relative recession of the root of
the appendix upward and to the left, until it comes into relation
with, or even under cover of, the ileo-colic junction and of the
terminal ileal coil entering the colon at this point.</p>

<p>The resulting characteristic adult position of the appendix in
these cases is as follows:</p>

<p>The termination of the cæcum proper, and the root of the
appendix are under cover of the terminal ileum and frequently
adherent to the parietal peritoneum of the iliac fossa (Fig. 555).
The distal portion of the appendix remains free, either hanging<span class="pagenum" title="258"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></span>
down and in over the brim of the pelvis (<a href="#Fig_542">Fig. 542</a>), or turned
upwards and to the left and coiled in several turns (<a href="#Fig_504">Figs. 504</a>,
555 and 556).</p>

<p>Finally the <i>erect vertical retro-cæcal</i> position of the appendix
presents several important variations in the disposition of the
peritoneal investment. In <a href="#Fig_503">Fig. 503</a>, taken from an embryo of
7.6&nbsp;cm. vertex-coccygeal length, the early complete recession of
the retro-cæcal ileal convolutions has probably permitted an early
apposition and adhesion of the beginning of the colon to the
dorsal prerenal parietal peritoneum. The subsequent descent
into the iliac fossa produces a bend in the ventral wall of the
colic tube, with a marked convexity directed downwards and forwards,
the apex of the bend situated at or near the level of the
ileo-colic junction, while the dorsal colic wall is held by the adhesion
to the parietal peritoneum, thus giving a backward inclination
to the entire cæcum and appendix. During the subsequent
descent of the cæcum proper this bend in the colon is
gradually diminished and the tube becomes straightened but the
apex of the cæcum remains turned back and the appendix is
placed in a more or less vertical erect position behind cæcum and
ascending colon.</p>

</table>

<p>As regards the disposition of the peritoneal membrane in this
type of appendix the following conditions are to be noted:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) (Schema, <a href="#Fig_552">Fig. 552</a>.)&mdash;The apex of the cæcum and the entire
appendix are extraperitoneal, imbedded in the loose connective
tissue which occupies the area of serous obliteration. The line
of peritoneal reflection from the dorsal wall of the secondary
caput coli to the parietal peritoneum of the right iliac fossa is
placed transversely below the true apex of the f&oelig;tal cæcum and
the root of the appendix. The latter tube, imbedded in connective
tissue, passes vertically upwards behind the ascending colon,
its tip frequently reaching the ventral surface of the right kidney.
A well-marked example of this arrangement in the adult is
shown in Figs. 557 and 558 (ventral and dorsal view, with peritoneal
reflection and vertical retro-colic appendix).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="259"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></span></p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) (Schema, <a href="#Fig_553">Fig. 553</a>.)&mdash;In other cases, with the same position
of the appendix, the entire cæcum and greater part of the ascending
colon remains free. The vertically erected appendix is closely
attached to the dorsal surface of the ascending colon, included
within the serous investment of the large intestine. The adhesion
of the latter is confined to a limited area near the hepatic flexure.
Consequently cæcum and greater part of ascending colon can be
turned up, away from the parietal peritoneum of the iliac fossa,
and the dorsal surface of the appendix shows the free serous
covering of the adjacent large intestine.</p>

<p>We may assume that this type of the peritoneal relations of the
appendix is produced in one of two ways:</p>

<p>1. Either the retro-colic appendix has become early attached
to the adjacent large intestine, whose dorsal surface in large part
remains free, or</p>

<p>2. The arrangement of the peritoneum indicated in schema,
<a href="#Fig_552">Fig. 552</a>, may be subsequently changed into that shown in schema,
<a href="#Fig_553">Fig. 553</a>, by a continued downward displacement of the cæcum,
producing a secondary serous investment of the dorsal surface of
appendix and part of ascending colon.</p>

<p>Examples of this type are found both in infantile and adult
subjects.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_538">Fig. 538</a>, taken from an infant three years of age, the cæcum
is lifted up to show the vertical position of the appendix behind
the cæcum and ascending colon, the dorsal surface of the large
intestine retaining its free serous covering. Another illustration
of this arrangement in a juvenile subject is shown in <a href="#Fig_529">Fig. 529</a>.
The same condition in the adult subject is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_539">Figs.

<p class="center"><b>C. ILEO-CÆCAL FOLDS AND FOSSÆ.</b></p>

<p>Certain peritoneal folds, either mesenteric in character, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
containing blood vessels, or non-vascular, pass between the terminal
ileum and the cæcum and appendix, modifying in some
instances very markedly the position and peritoneal relations of
the structures.</p>

<p>In considering the influence which these vascular mesenteric
and non-vascular serous folds exert in producing further changes
in the shape, position and relations of the human appendix it is
necessary to remember that in the early embryonal stages these
bands and folds of the peritoneum appear only slightly marked,
but that they gain their importance and influence on the final
adult configuration of the cæcal pouch and appendix in the
course of the further development of these structures.</p>

<p>For this reason the comparative study of the corresponding
parts in other vertebrates, especially in certain mammalia, is of
the utmost value, if we seek to explain and understand the derivation,
significance and typical arrangement of these folds. We
have seen that the cæcum as found in the large majority of
mammalian forms is equivalent to the cæcum and appendix of
the human subject and anthropoid apes; that in other words the
vermiform appendix represents the distal segment of a cæcal
pouch, originally uniform in caliber, which has remained undeveloped,
while the proximal portion has progressed evenly with
the general development of the alimentary canal to form the
cæcum proper. We have seen that this tendency to retain the<span class="pagenum" title="261"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span>
distal portion of the pouch in a rudimentary condition, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the
production of an appendage to the cæcum proper, is encountered
in several of the lower forms, as certain Marsupials, Carnivores,
Ungulates and Lemurs. The morphology of the ileo-cæcal folds
is hence best understood by considering these structures as they
appear in connection with the various cæcal types presented by
the lower mammalia. Their arrangement and significance can
here be readily made out. On the other hand, in studying these
structures in the human appendix we are following lines which
are already becoming indistinct on account of the rudimentary
character of the organ, which we must regard as undergoing an
exceedingly slow process of reduction, with a view to its ultimate
elimination from the body. We have seen that the structural
uncertainty impressed on cæcum and appendix by this evolutionary
influence finds its expression in the wide range of variation
in size and arrangement which these parts present. Necessarily,
of course, this tendency to variation is shared, and even exhibited
to a more marked degree, by what we can term the accessory
structures connected with cæcum and appendix, viz., the mesenteric
vascular and non-vascular serous folds passing to them from
the ileum.</p>

<p>We can most profitably begin our consideration of these folds
in a form in which they are preserved in their entire and original
development, and then successively trace the changes leading up
to the normal disposition in the human subject. Such a type is
presented by the cæcum of <i>Ateles ater</i>, the black-handed spider
monkey (<a href="#Fig_444">Figs. 444</a> and <a href="#Fig_445">445</a>). The cæcum of this animal presents a
uniform crescentic curve, with the concavity directed upward and
to the left, and the gradual diminution in the caliber of the pouch,
from the ileo-colic junction to the apex, denotes the tendency to
retain the distal segment in a rudimentary condition, foreshadowing
the eventual formation of a vermiform appendix.</p>

<p>In the ventral view, with the terminal ileum lifted up, the following
arrangement of folds passing between ileum and cæcum
is noted (<a href="#Fig_444">Figs. 444</a> and <a href="#Fig_445">445</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="262"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Vascular Mesenteric Folds.</i>&mdash;The peritoneal vascular folds,
carrying the blood vessels to supply the cæcum, are two in number,
a ventral (1) and dorsal (3). They are of nearly equal size
and extent, passing from the ventral and dorsal aspect of the ileo-colic
junction nearly to the apex of the cæcum. Each contains
a branch of the ileo-colic artery, which forks in the ileo-colic
mesentery, in the angle between ileum and large intestine. The
ventral branch continues in the ventral mesenteric fold (<a href="#Fig_445">Fig.
445</a>) downward across the ventral surface of the ileo-colic junction
to supply the ventral part of the cæcum, while the dorsal
branch descends behind the ileo-colic junction, preserving a similar
course in the dorsal mesenteric fold. The dorsal arterial
branch is somewhat larger than the ventral and its distribution
extends a little further down to the actual apex of the cæcum.</p>

two vascular mesenteric folds a third serous reduplication, carrying
no blood vessels, is found passing between the ileum and
cæcum. This fold begins, in the preparation from which the
figure is taken, on the ileum opposite the attached mesenteric
border, 2.7&nbsp;cm. from the ileo-colic junction, and passes for exactly
the same distance down on the adjacent left concave surface of
the cæcum. It is placed a little nearer to the dorsal than to the
ventral vascular fold, so that it passes, if the distance between the
two vascular folds on the cæcum be divided into three parts, at
the junction of the dorsal third with the ventral two thirds. The
production of this intermediate non-vascular ileo-cæcal reduplication,
which is of very constant occurrence in the mammalian
series, is to be led back to the development of the cæcum.
When the pouch protrudes from the smooth surface of the embryonic
intestine opposite the mesenteric border, it extends backward
along the future small intestine and lifts off the serous investment
of the gut in the form of a small peritoneal plate filling
the interval between itself and the adjacent ileum. A very perfect
illustration of this process can be seen in the instance of Meckel&rsquo;s
diverticulum shown in Fig. 561. The proximal portion of the<span class="pagenum" title="263"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></span>
diverticulum is here still closely connected to the small intestine
along which it extends, both being surrounded by the
common visceral peritoneum. The distal part of the diverticulum
has separated more completely from the intestine, and in so
doing has drawn out the serous investment in the form of the
triangular fold which is seen to pass between the free margin of
the intestine and the adjacent surface of the pouch. The same
process can be followed in its different stages in certain normal
mammalian cæcal types.</p>

</div>

<p>In this connection it may be noted that the production of the
cæcal vascular folds and their relation to the mesentery is also
very perfectly illustrated in some forms of Meckel&rsquo;s diverticulum.
Thus in the preparation shown in Fig. 562, a broad triangular
serous fold passes from the ileal mesentery to the margin of the
diverticulum, carrying the blood vessels which supply the pouch.
If the section of the intestine to the left of the figure is regarded
as representing the terminal ileum, that to the right the colon,
and the diverticulum the cæcal pouch, the formation of the fold
and its relation to the mesentery, blood vessels and intestine will
correspond closely to the ileo-cæcal vascular folds.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_350">Fig. 350</a> shows the ileo-colic junction and cæcum of <i>Halmaturus
derbyanus</i>, the rock kangaroo. The cæcum here extends
backwards along the free border of the ileum to which it is closely
bound by the common investing visceral peritoneum for the
greater part of its extent. In another marsupial form, a small
species of opossum from Trinidad (<a href="#Fig_349">Fig. 349</a>), the cæcum has separated
itself more completely from the adjacent small intestine&mdash;thus
drawing out the peritoneum into a narrow connecting fold.
Finally, in the Virginia opossum (<a href="#Fig_348">Fig. 348</a>), the ileum has attained
the usual position at right angles to cæcum and colon. The
former pouch is separated from the small intestine by a considerable
interval and the angle between the two is filled out by a
well-developed triangular serous fold, connecting the free margin
of the terminal ileum and the adjacent left border of the
cæcum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="264"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a></span></p>

<p>This is the &ldquo;intermediate non-vascular&rdquo; ileo-cæcal fold.</p>

<p>Passing now from the condition presented by <i>Ateles</i>, with three
fully developed and distinct ileo-cæcal folds, to the next stage
leading up to the normal human arrangement, we find the same
illustrated in the cæcum of another new-world monkey, <i>Mycetes
fuscus</i>, the brown howler monkey, shown in the ventral and dorsal
views in <a href="#Fig_449">Figs. 449</a> and <a href="#Fig_450">450</a>. The ventral vascular fold (<a href="#Fig_449">Fig. 449</a>, 1)
is still well developed, the contained ventral branch of the ileo-colic
artery descending over the ventral wall of the ileo-colic junction
and cæcum and supplying both. The dorsal vascular fold (<a href="#Fig_450">Fig.
450</a>, 2), on the other hand, is nearly completely fused with the intermediate
non-vascular reduplication (<a href="#Fig_449">Figs. 449</a> and <a href="#Fig_450">450</a>, 3), the
approximation between these structures exhibited by <i>Ateles</i> having
in <i>Mycetes</i> reached the point of actual union, so that the larger
dorsal branch of the ileo-cæcal artery descends to the apex of the
cæcum in the following manner: The main post-cæcal artery
passes over the dorsal surface of the ileo-colic junction included
in a short serous fold which corresponds to the dorsal vascular
fold of <i>Ateles</i>. Beyond the lower border of the ileo-colic junction
this fold fuses with the intermediate non-vascular fold, one arterial
branch descending along the line of attachment of this fold
to the cæcum, the other distributed over the dorsal surface of
the pouch.</p>

<p>A third type, also taken from the lower Primates, is presented
by the cæcum of a cynomorphous monkey, <i>Cercopithecus sab&aelig;us</i>,
the African green monkey, shown in <a href="#Fig_432">Fig. 432</a>, in the ventral and
left aspect with the terminal ileum lifted up. The cæcum of this
animal is comparatively short, somewhat conical, terminating in
a blunt apex. The vascular supply is arranged on the same
type as in <i>Ateles</i> and <i>Mycetes</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, a trunk of the ileo-colic artery
divides at the ileo-colic notch, one branch descending ventrad, the
other dorsad of the ileo-colic junction. The slightly larger size
of the dorsal vessel, noted in <i>Ateles</i> and <i>Mycetes</i>, has been
increased in <i>Cercopithecus</i> until the ventral artery (1) supplies
merely the front of the ileo-colic junction and the upper part of<span class="pagenum" title="265"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a></span>
the adjoining ventral wall of the cæcum, while the larger dorsal
vessel (2) descends behind the ileo-colic junction, supplying the
same and the entire dorsal and apical portions of the cæcum.
The relation of these cæcal arteries to the peritoneum is moreover
different from that encountered in <i>Ateles</i>. In place of running in
distinct mesenteric folds, as in the latter species, the vessels pass
close to the surface of the intestine, merely covered and partly
surrounded by slightly redundant visceral peritoneum containing
numerous pads of epiploic fat, which bead the course of the vessels
at regular intervals. Between the two arteries the intermediate
non-vascular fold (2) is seen, presenting much the same
arrangement as in <i>Ateles</i> and passing between the left border of
the cæcum and the adjacent margin of the ileum, nearer to the
dorsal larger than to the ventral smaller cæcal artery.</p>

<p>We have, therefore, in the three types just considered, the following
variations in the arrangement of the vascular and non-vascular
folds:</p>

</div>

<p>We may judge from this series that the following factors are
capable of materially modifying the definite arrangement of the
structures:</p>

<p>1. The vascular folds are capable of reduction until the vessels
run close to the intestinal surface, merely covered by somewhat
redundant peritoneum containing epiploic appendages. (<i>Cercopithecus.</i>)</p>

<p>2. The dorsal cæcal artery tends to assume in all three forms
the greater share in the cæcal vascular supply. This tendency
is slightly developed in <i>Ateles</i>, becomes more pronounced in <i>Mycetes</i>,
and is well marked in <i>Cercopithecus</i>, in which animal the dorsal
vessel nearly replaces the ventral branch, the latter confining
itself to the ventral surface of the ileo-colic junction and the adjacent
ventral parts of the cæcal wall.</p>

<p>3. The intermediate non-vascular fold is placed nearer to the
dorsal larger than to the ventral smaller cæcal artery. This condition,
present in both <i>Ateles</i> and <i>Cercopithecus</i>, foreshadows the
fusion of the intermediate and dorsal vascular folds at the lower
border of the ileo-colic junction, as seen in <i>Mycetes</i>.</p>

<p>4. This fusion of the two folds named in <i>Mycetes</i> results in giving
different values to the dorsal vascular fold in its proximal and
distal segments. The proximal segment descends from the ileo-colic
notch behind the ileo-colic junction to its lower border as a
distinct fold. Beyond this point its fusion with the distal (cæcal)
segment of the intermediate fold rounds out a fossa, the inferior
or posterior ileo-cæcal, which is consequently bounded in front
by the intermediate vascular fold, behind by the proximal segment
of the dorsal vascular fold, to the right side by the inner
wall of the cæcum, between the intermediate and dorsal vascular
folds, above by the lower border of ileum and ileo-colic junction,
and below by the fusion of the two folds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="267"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a></span></p>

<p>This pocket or fossa which is the most important and constant
of the peritoneal recesses in the neighborhood of the cæcum,
opens upward and to the left.</p>

<p>5. A superior or anterior ileo-cæcal fossa, formed in cases of
well-developed ventral vascular fold between the same and the
ventral wall of the ileo-colic junction, is of small size and shallow.</p>

<p>The cause of the greater development of the dorsal as compared
with the ventral cæcal artery is probably to be sought in
the adhesion of the colon to the dorsal parietal peritoneum. In
<i>Cercopithecus</i> the dorsal surface of the ascending colon is adherent
to the parietal peritoneum down as far as the iliac region and beginning
of the cæcum, whereas in <i>Mycetes</i> the entire cæcum, as
well as the ascending colon, are free and non-adherent to the abdominal
parietes. The influence of this adhesion on the arrangement
of the vascular supply of the lower portion of the ascending
colon and cæcum appears to be important. Some of the
departures from the <i>Ateles</i> type presented by <i>Cercopithecus</i> become
still better developed in the human subject, where the adhesion
of the ascending colon and the obliteration of the apposed serous
surfaces of ascending mesocolon and parietal peritoneum is normally
complete, even if the cæcum remains entirely free, or
only adheres to the iliac parietal peritoneum in the proximal
part of its dorsal surface. Comparison with forms presenting
non-adherent colic and cæcal tubes indicates that the adhesion
determines the relative size and arrangement of the ileo-colic
vessels.</p>

<p>Thus the partially adherent colon and cæcum of <i>Cercopithecus</i>
presents, compared with the free tube of <i>Ateles</i> and <i>Mycetes</i>, a
marked reduction of the ventral and a corresponding enlargement
of the dorsal cæcal artery. Further progress in the same direction
is noted in the human subject where normally the ascending colon
and at times the proximal portion of the cæcum are adherent to
the dorsal parietal peritoneum.</p>

<p>It appears that in the adhesion of the colic tube to the parietal
peritoneum the dorsal ileo-colic vessels find an element favorable<span class="pagenum" title="268"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a></span>
to their more complete development and extension, replacing in
part or entirely the ventral cæcal artery which becomes limited
in distribution to the region of the ileo-colic junction. The adhesion
and fixation of the dorsal wall of the intestine seems to afford
an advantage to the dorsal vessel, whereas the greater mobility
and the alternating conditions of distension and contraction, with
variations of intracæcal pressure, depending upon the contents of
the pouch, appear to operate unfavorably upon the development
of the ventral vessel.</p>

<p>This view is borne out by the conditions observed in the exceptional
instances in which in the human subject the ventral artery
assumes the large share in the supply of cæcum and appendix
(cf. <a href="#Page_276">p.&nbsp;276</a>). In all the cases observed the type of the cæcum
indicated delayed or imperfect colic adhesion, and the ascending
mesocolon remained partially free.</p>

<p>1. Ventral cæcal artery, surrounded by epiploic appendages.</p>

<p>2. Dorsal vascular fold, forming appendicular mesentery.</p>

<p>3. Intermediate non-vascular fold.</p>
</div>

<p>If we now compare the conditions above described for <i>Ateles</i>,
<i>Mycetes</i>, <i>Cercopithecus</i> with those usually found in man and in the
anthropoid apes, we may appreciate the significance of the structures
encountered by beginning the investigation with a type in
which the derivation of the different parts is still quite evident.
Such a condition is presented by the preparation shown in Fig.
563, taken from a child one year of age. Here the descent of the
cæcum has evidently been quite rapid and uniform without dorsal
adhesion. The cæcum and ascending colon remain free and can
still be lifted away from the ventral facies of the right kidney and
turned toward the median line to a point somewhat beyond the
renal hilus. The cæcum hangs downward vertically and the
appendix arises from the funnel-shaped apex of the pouch.</p>

<p>The ventral cæcal branch of the ileo-colic artery is slightly developed,
(1) as a small vessel descending in an epiploic fold over
the ventral surface of the ileo-colic junction as far as the root of
the appendix. The intermediate non-vascular fold (3) is well
marked, measuring 2.9&nbsp;cm. in length, extending from the free
border of the terminal ileum to the cæcum and appendix and
crossing over the well-developed dorsal vascular fold (2), which<span class="pagenum" title="269"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a></span>
descends, as the appendicular mesenterolium, to the tip of the
appendix, carrying the dorsal artery. In studying the conditions
presented by this specimen, it is not difficult to trace the analogous
structures in the cæca of <i>Cercopithecus</i>, <i>Ateles</i> and <i>Mycetes</i>.
The same vascular and non-vascular serous reduplications are
found passing between the ileum and cæcum. In accordance
with the type presented by <i>Cercopithecus</i> the ventral artery is
much reduced and runs in a short serous fold loaded with epiploic
appendages. The dorsal artery, on the other hand, is well
developed and the intermediate non-vascular fold is distinct. In
their relative arrangement these folds follow the <i>Ateles</i> type.
The dorsal vascular fold forms the true mesentery of the appendix,
and, although close to and crossed by the intermediate non-vascular
reduplication, remains still quite separable and distinct
from the same; consequently the lower limit of the usual posterior
ileo-cæcal fossa, produced by the fusion of the dorsal vascular
and the intermediate non-vascular fold, is absent.</p>

<p>A very perfect illustration of this type of the human ileo-cæcal
fold is presented by the preparation of <i>Gorilla savagei</i> shown in
<a href="#Fig_457">Fig. 457</a>. The ventral fold and artery appear reduced in this
animal. The dorsal vascular fold forms a broad triangular plate
of serous membrane carrying the dorsal artery in its free border
and extending to the tip of the appendix.</p>

<p>The intermediate non-vascular fold is narrow but distinct, continued
for a considerable distance along the ileum, opposite to the
attached border, but only for a short extent along the left border
of the cæcum below the ileo-colic junction. It crosses the ventral
surface of the broad dorsal vascular fold in passing to the cæcum,
but remains entirely free and is not adherent to the same.</p>

<p>Consequently here again the dorsal or posterior ileo-cæcal fossa
loses its distal limitation. The usual arrangement of the parts,
as found in the human subject and derived from the preceding, is
well illustrated by another anthropoid ape, <i>Hylobates hoolock</i>.
<a href="#Fig_455">Fig. 455</a> shows the ileo-cæcum of this animal in the ventral view
and the homologous parts, as compared with <i>Gorilla</i>, are readily<span class="pagenum" title="270"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a></span>
recognized. On turning the terminal ileum ventrad and cephalad
(<a href="#Fig_456">Fig. 456</a>), it is, however, seen that the intermediate non-vascular
fold does not merely cross the dorsal vascular reduplication,
as in <i>Gorilla</i>, but that it has begun to adhere to the same at the
point of intersection. Consequently a well-marked and clearly
limited posterior or dorsal ileo-cæcal fossa is formed, bounded
ventrally by the intermediate fold at its accession to the cæcum,
dorsally by the proximal part of the dorsal vascular fold, to the
right by the left wall of the cæcum, behind by the attachment of
the intermediate fold, below by the confluence of the two folds,
and above by the lower border of ileum and ileo-colic junction.</p>

<p>The open mouth of the fossa looks to the left. <a href="#Fig_464">Fig. 464</a>, taken
from an adult specimen of the chimpanzee, <i>Troglodytes niger</i>,
shows the extent of the dorsal vascular fold and of its connection
with the mesentery of the terminal ileum.</p>

<p>The intermediate non-vascular fold extends from the ileum
downwards along the entire left border of the cæcum to the root
of the appendix, fusing with the dorsal vascular fold and rounding
out a deep posterior ileo-cæcal fossa.</p>

<p>The typical arrangement, as encountered in the human subject,
corresponds closely to the conditions presented by these anthropoid
apes.</p>

<p>In Fig. 564, taken from an adult male human subject, the dorsal
surface of the ascending colon and of the ileo-colic junction is
adherent to the parietal peritoneum. The distention of the
cæcum is nearly uniform, the right sacculation being only slightly
larger than the left. The appendix, measuring 18.4&nbsp;cm. in
length, arises from the dorsal surface of the caput coli, 1.7&nbsp;cm.
from the point where the ventral longitudinal muscular band
turns around the caudal end of the pouch between the two sacculations,
and 3.7&nbsp;cm. below the caudal margin of the ileo-colic
junction.</p>

<p>The dorsal vascular fold (2), forming the broad appendicular
mesentery (1), is well developed and free in its distal portion, extending,
with gradually diminishing width, to the apex of the<span class="pagenum" title="271"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a></span>
appendix. The proximal segment of this fold (between 1 and 2)
descends over the dorsal surface of the ileo-colic junction and
meets (at 4) the intermediate non-vascular fold (3) which extends
between the ileum and cæcum, rounding out a crescentic
ridge (4) which bounds the entrance into the posterior ileo-cæcal
fossa (between 2 and 3). The influence of the folds and of the
blood vessels on the position and curves of the appendix is quite
apparent in this preparation.</p>

<p>The dorsal larger branch of the ileo-colic artery, supplying
cæcum and appendix, passes over the dorsal surface of the ileo-colic
junction (2) where the same, as well as the adjacent dorsal
surface of the colon, is adherent to the parietal peritoneum. At
the point where the dorsal vascular fold intersects and fuses with
the intermediate non-vascular fold (4) the artery divides into a
proximal and distal branch. The former proceeds to the cæcum
and root of the appendix, reaching this tube at the point marked
5. The latter continues (from 1 on) in the free border of the appendicular
mesentery to the beginning of the distal third of the
appendix, from which point on the fold extends as a narrow
reduplication to the tip of the tube. The segment of the appendix
situated between these two main arterial branches is
thrown into several coils, the expression of the continued growth
between two points relatively fixed by the accession of the two
arterial branches. The pathological significance of these bends
is apparent when we consider the effect which the kinking of the
tube would have on catarrhal and other inflammations accompanied
by distension of the appendix.</p>

<p>Typical examples of the posterior ileo-cæcal fossa and of the
mutual relationship of the limiting folds are seen in Figs. 565 and
566, both taken from adult human subjects.</p>

<p>The significance and mutual relations of the folds seen in the
preparations just considered&mdash;which illustrate the typical adult
human arrangement of the structures&mdash;will perhaps be best understood
by comparison with an adult cæcum in which the infantile
condition, as seen in <a href="#Fig_563">Fig. 563</a>, has become further developed.</p>

<p>Fig. 567 shows the dorsal view of such a preparation. The
cæcum is funnel-shaped with the apex, carrying the root of the
appendix, turned upward and to the left, the sacculation to the
right of the ventral muscular band being somewhat dilated. The
appendix&mdash;7.2&nbsp;cm. long&mdash;turns sharply upward and to the left,
closely applied to the left cæcal sacculation, passes dorsad to the
ileo-colic junction and lies in its terminal part under cover of the
ileo-colic mesentery. The ventral branch of the ileo-colic artery
descends over the ileo-colic junction, supplying the ventral wall
of the cæcum. The intermediate non-vascular fold (3) is 3.9&nbsp;cm.
long and entirely free.</p>

<p>The dorsal vascular fold contains the large dorsal branch of the
ileo-colic artery, dividing into two main branches. The first of
these (1) passes distally in the free edge of the fold to the terminal
part of the appendix. The other proximal branch (2) turns downward
to the root of the appendix and the adjacent wall of the
cæcum, aiding materially in holding the proximal upturned
segment of the appendix in contact with the left cæcal sacculation.</p>

<p>The intermediate fold, short in its cæcal attachment, does not
meet the dorsal vascular fold at any point, consequently the ileo-cæcal
fossa is not limited caudad toward the root of the appendix.
The conditions presented by this specimen correspond exactly to
those found in the gorilla (<a href="#Fig_457">Fig. 457</a>) and in the human infantile
preparation (<a href="#Fig_563">Fig. 563</a>).</p>

<p>In comparing <a href="#Fig_564">Figs. 564</a> and 567 it will be noticed that the line
of fusion between the intermediate fold and the dorsal vascular
fold (<a href="#Fig_564">Fig. 564</a>, 4) corresponds to the point where the dorsal ileo-cæcal
artery divides into its proximal and distal branches (Fig.
567, angle between 1 and 2). Fig. 567 shows that the proximal
arterial twig, even without fusion with the intermediate fold,
suffices to influence to a considerable degree the curves and position
of the appendix, inasmuch as it serves to hold the proximal
segment of the tube closely applied in the erected position to the
surface of the left cæcal sacculation. The intermediate segment of
the appendix, between the points of accession of the two arterial<span class="pagenum" title="273"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a></span>
branches, is most prone to develop spiral twists and bends, especially
when the usual fusion of the two folds takes place and still
further fixes the parts, while the distal segment, carrying the
narrow crescentic terminal appendicular mesentery, remains free.</p>

<p>3. Intermediate non-vascular fold fusing with 2 and forming a narrow caudal limit to the

<p>Finally, in a certain number of cases, an intermediate condition
between the types presented by <a href="#Fig_564">Figs. 564</a> and <a href="#Fig_567">567</a> is encountered.
In Fig. 568 the general arrangement of the parts corresponds
pretty accurately to that seen in <a href="#Fig_566">Fig. 566</a>, but the transition from
a completely free intermediate non-vascular fold to one which has
begun to fuse with the dorsal vascular fold is evident. The
cæcum is bent upward and to the left, the caput coli being formed
by the right sacculation. The appendix, 7.8&nbsp;cm. long, takes a
wide <span class="fs130">&#8768;</span>-shaped curve. The convexity of the proximal curve corresponds
to the point where the proximal appendicular artery (2)
passes to the tube. The non-vascular intermediate fold (3), measuring
2.2&nbsp;cm., fuses with the dorsal vascular fold at this point.</p>

<p>The three preparations illustrate serially the share which the
peritoneal folds take in the formation of the posterior ileo-cæcal
fossa.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_566">Fig. 566</a> the failure of the intermediate fold to meet and
fuse with the dorsal vascular fold has left the caudal boundary of
the fossa (between 2 and 3) incomplete, the ventral and dorsal
walls being formed by the folds in question. Fig. 568, in which
fusion between the non-vascular and the dorsal vascular folds has
commenced, shows the shallow form of the complete fossa under
these conditions, while in <a href="#Fig_567">Fig. 567</a>, with extensive union of the
folds, the fossa has correspondingly increased in depth.</p>

<p>A similar series is shown in Figs. 569, 570 and 571. In Fig.
569, taken from an adult subject, the intermediate non-vascular
fold is entirely free, the dorsal branch of the ileo-cæcal artery
passes to cæcum and appendix in an area of adhesion between
parietal peritoneum and the intestine which includes the dorsal
vascular fold. There is consequently no caudal boundary to the
ileo-cæcal fossa. Figs. 570 and 571 are both taken from infantile
preparations.</p>

<p>In Fig. 570 the dorsal vascular and the intermediate folds nearly
meet at the root of the appendix. They serve to outline the
fossa, which appears completed in Fig. 571 by the actual meeting
and fusion of the folds.</p>

<p><i>The Ileo-cæcal Folds in the Anthropoid Apes</i>.&mdash;(1) <i>Chimpanzee,
Troglodytes niger.</i></p>

<p>The structures in a juvenile specimen of this animal are shown
in <a href="#Fig_460">Figs. 460</a> and <a href="#Fig_461">461</a>.</p>

<p>The ventral vascular fold (<a href="#Fig_460">Fig. 460</a>, 3), containing epiploic fat,
descends over the ileo-colic junction nearly to the level of the
lower ileal margin. The intermediate non-vascular fold (<a href="#Fig_460">Figs.
460</a> and <a href="#Fig_461">461</a>, 2), derived from the ileum opposite to the mesenteric
border, passes to the ventral and left aspects of the cæcum and
meets, near the root of the appendix, the dorsal vascular fold
(<a href="#Fig_461">Fig. 461</a>, 3) carrying the dorsal cæcal branch of the ileo-colic
artery, which ramifies over the cæcum and supplies the appendix.</p>

<p>The appendix measures 12.3&nbsp;cm. and presents a terminal hook,
slightly dilated.</p>

<p>The appendicular mesentery terminates within the concavity of
this hook and measures 1.5&nbsp;cm. in width at the broadest part,
about 4.5&nbsp;cm. from the root of the appendix.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_462">Figs. 462</a> and <a href="#Fig_463">463</a> show the cæcum of the adult chimpanzee in
the ventral and dorsal view. The ventral vascular fold (<a href="#Fig_462">Fig.
462</a>, 1) is well developed, heavily fringed with epiploic appendages.</p>

<p>The non-vascular fold is extremely short and tense, fusing with
the short appendicular mesentery near the point where in the
dorsal view (<a href="#Fig_463">Fig. 463</a>) the appendix is seen bent at its origin
sharply to the right.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_464">Fig. 464</a>, also taken from an adult specimen of the same animal,
shows a very well-developed dorsal vascular fold, which fuses with
the intermediate fold to limit a distinct ileo-cæcal recess.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee, therefore, agrees closely with the human
subject in the arrangement of the folds.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Orang, Simia satyrus.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="275"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></span></p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_458">Figs. 458</a> and <a href="#Fig_459">459</a> the arrangement of the folds in an adult
specimen of the orang is shown.</p>

<p>The ventral cæcal artery (<a href="#Fig_458">Fig. 458</a>) is well developed, forming
with the peritoneal fold and epiploic appendages surrounding it,
a sharp sickle-shaped edge which descends over the ventral surface
of the ileo-colic junction following the curve of the left cæcal
margin, and turning its concavity to the left toward the entering
ileum.</p>

<p>The ventral cæcal artery follows the left margin of the cæcum
below the ileo-cæcal junction and passes for 0.5&nbsp;cm. upon the
portion of the pouch which turns up behind the terminal ileum.</p>

<p>The dorsal cæcal artery is a vessel of large size, supplying
branches to the narrow appendicular mesentery which extends,
with many epiploic appendages, to within 9&nbsp;mm. of the blunt
apex of the appendix. 2.5&nbsp;cm. beyond the first bend in the appendix
the fold is narrowed to a fringe not more than 0.75&nbsp;cm.
wide. Up to this point the dorsal vascular fold measures 1.5&nbsp;cm.
in width, and just where it narrows it is joined by the intermediate
non-vascular fold (<a href="#Fig_459">Fig. 459</a>), which forms a membranous band, 3.3&nbsp;cm.
wide in the middle, spread out in the angle between the
lower and dorsal surfaces of the ileum and the dorsal surface of
the cæcum which turns up behind the ileo-colic junction. Between
this fold and the dorsal vascular fold is seen the deep recess
of the posterior ileo-cæcal fossa&mdash;which by reason of the sharp
curve of the cæcum looks not only to the left but also upward
and backward.</p>

<p>Direct comparison of the preparations of these two anthropoid
apes just described with the conditions found in many adult
human cæca shows the close correspondence in the arrangement
of these folds and of their influence on the configuration of the
parts.</p>

<p>Figs. 572 and 573&mdash;taken from an adult human subject&mdash;show
a cæcum and appendix which almost reproduces that of the chimpanzee
illustrated in <a href="#Fig_462">Figs. 462</a> and <a href="#Fig_463">463</a> and closely resembles that
of the orang.</p>

<p>Fig. 572, giving the ventral view, shows, by the course of the
ventral longitudinal muscular band, the turn of the cæcum upwards
and to the left. The ventral cæcal artery runs in a fold
(1) loaded with epiploic appendages.</p>

<p>The non-vascular intermediate fold (Fig. 573, 2) passes to the
root of the appendix, joining the proximal segment of the dorsal
vascular fold in which the dorsal branch of the ileo-colic artery
runs to the tip of the appendix. The distal two thirds of the
appendicular mesentery are free.</p>

the folds appear well developed. The intermediate and dorsal
vascular folds are quite distinct structures, although fusion (<a href="#Fig_456">Fig.

ileo-cæcal fossa.</p>

<p>4. <i>Gorilla, Gorilla savagei</i> (<a href="#Fig_457">Fig. 457</a>).&mdash;Finally in the gorilla all

</div>

<p>This condition is occasionally encountered. Dr. Martin, in a
recent examination of the vascular supply of cæcum and appendix
in one hundred subjects, found it to obtain in six instances.</p>

<p>Apparently the dorsal wall of the cæcum and of the proximal
segment of the ascending colon remains free in these cases and
does not become adherent to the parietal peritoneum. The shape
of the pouch, moreover, indicates a free and unimpeded embryonal
cæcal descent. The normal relative size of the two vascular
folds is reversed. A good example of this variation, in the
cæcum of an infant, is seen in <a href="#Fig_516">Fig. 516</a>. The same arrangement
in an adult specimen is seen in Fig. 574.</p>

<p>In the Slow Lemur (<i>Nycticebus tardigradus</i>) (<a href="#Fig_420">Fig. 420</a>) the ventral
artery is normally the larger of the two, extending in the
ventral fold to the tip of the reduced appendix of the cæcal pouch.</p>

</div>

<p>Normally the reduced ventral artery crosses the ileo-colic
junction in a slightly developed ventral vascular fold, closely adherent
to the intestine, with a very narrow free margin. The superior
or ventral ileo-cæcal fossa in these cases is very shallow and
confined (Fig. 574) to the ventral surface of the ileo-colic junction.
Occasionally the fold is better developed and fuses with the intermediate
non-vascular fold, producing a fossa of greater extent,
which is bounded dorsad by the ileum, ventrad and cephalad by
the ventral fold, caudad by the fusion of this fold with the intermediate
reduplication, and to the right by the left wall of the
cæcum. <a href="#Fig_576">Figs. 576</a>, <a href="#Fig_577">577</a>, <a href="#Fig_578">578</a> and <a href="#Fig_579">579</a> show this aberrant disposition
of the structures in a series of adult human cæca.</p>

<p>A corresponding arrangement is noted in the preparation of
the cæcum of <i>Cercopithecus campbellii</i> (<a href="#Fig_433">Fig. 433</a>). The large intermediate
fold is joined by the ventral vascular fold, thus defining
the lower boundary of ventral ileo-cæcal fossa.</p>

(Columbia University Museum, No. 1663.)
</div>

<p>I have encountered one instance of this arrangement in an infant,
whose cæcum and ileo-colic junction is shown in Fig. 580.
Both the ventral and dorsal arteries in this case were equally
developed, and shared equally in the supply of cæcum and
appendix. Both vascular folds fused with the intermediate fold,
thus producing two typical ileo-cæcal fossæ, one ventral, the
other dorsal.</p>

<p>(<i>D</i>) <i>Abnormal positions of the appendix due to variations in the
arrangement and tension of the intermediate fold.</i></p>

<p><a href="#Fig_510">Fig. 510</a> shows a f&oelig;tal cæcum in the ventral view. The ventral
vascular fold (3) is well developed. The non-vascular fold
is short, arising from the ventral surface of the ileum, instead of
from the free border of the intestine opposite to the mesenteric
attachment. It fuses with the ventral vascular fold a short distance
below the ileo-colic junction, thus limiting a small ventral<span class="pagenum" title="278"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a></span>
ileo-cæcal fossa. The dorsal cæcal artery in this specimen was
large, but the fold carrying it extremely narrow.</p>

<p>The preparation illustrates the type resulting from the reduction
in size and extent of the non-vascular and mesenteric folds.
The intermediate fold is reduced to a short and narrow band.
Compared with the usual infantile type the cæcum lacks the
characteristic turn upwards and to the left, possibly in consequence
of the slight traction caused by the rudimentary intermediate
fold. The pouch occupies a nearly vertical pendent
position, which the appendix, arising from the lowest point of the
cæcal funnel, shares. The appendix is not drawn into the retro-ileal
position by the dorsal vascular fold, which is much reduced.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_511">Fig. 511</a>, representing the cæcum and appendix of a f&oelig;tus
at term, the effect of the tense non-vascular intermediate fold (2)
is seen in the sharp turn to the left which it imparts to the nearly
transversely directed funnel-shaped cæcum. The appendix (1) is
coiled spirally for 1&frac34; turns behind the ileo-colic junction, with
the tip directed upward behind the mesentery of the terminal
ileum. The non-vascular intermediate fold (2) extends to the
rest of the appendix. It appears short in its cæcal attachment, on
account of the turn of the cæcum backwards and to the left and
the close connection between the adjacent margins of the ileum
and cæcum.</p>

<p>In Fig. 581&mdash;a f&oelig;tal preparation at term&mdash;the cæcum is turned
to the left, below and behind the terminal ileum. The non-vascular
fold (2) is well developed as regards <i>length</i> of <i>ileal</i> attachment,
but is very narrow and tense, passing between ileum and
the proximal curve of the cæcum behind the ileo-colic junction,
where it merges with the dorsal vascular fold. The appendix
takes a sudden turn caudad at this point and then continues up
<i>ventrad</i> to the ileo-colic junction, the proximal portion being kept
firmly in contact with the dorsal and caudal circumference of the
ileum by the tension of the non-vascular band. It is quite evident
that this peculiar turn of the appendix is directly due to the
confining influence of the non-vascular band&mdash;which passes from<span class="pagenum" title="279"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></span>
its ileal attachment almost directly dorsad to the point of fusion
with the dorsal vascular fold, causing the sharp downward and
forward turn of the proximal segment of the appendix. Similar
cases with ventral position of the appendix are shown in <a href="#Fig_545">Figs. 545</a>
and 582.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">1</span></a> In the embryos of reptiles, birds and mammals folds of the somatopleure arise externally
to the constricting furrows by means of which the embryo is gradually separated from
the yolk-sac, with the resulting formation of the intestinal and abdominal walls. These
folds, situated at the head, tail and on the sides, grow upwards and finally meet and unite
to form a membranous sac called the <i>amnion</i>. Hence these higher vertebrates (reptiles,
birds and mammals) are called <i>Amniota</i>, in contradistinction to fishes and amphibia who
have no amnion and are hence known as <i>Anamnia</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">2</span></a> The student should not be confused by the fact that a considerable portion of the pancreatic
gland in the cat will be found included between the layers of the great omentum, extending
over to the left side of the abdomen. This circumstance will be found of importance
in studying the development of the dorsal mesogastrium and of the structures connected with
it. For the present attention should only be given to the right extremity or head of the
pancreas, situated close to the duodenum and included between the layers of the mesoduodenum.</p></div>

abdomen. It possesses a well-differentiated intestinal tract, several coils of small intestine,
a well-marked cæcum and large intestine. The examination of this or a similar reptilian
form is to be highly recommended. Iguana is easily obtained in any of our large cities, as a
considerable number of these animals are annually imported from Mexico and the South
American states.</p></div>

the liver shifts relatively backwards, so that the diaphragmatic attachment, originally directed
cephalad, now looks dorsad and forms part of the dorsal or &ldquo;posterior&rdquo; surface of the adult
organ. The original ventral surface looks cephalad, as well as ventrad, forming the convex
surface which in the adult rests in contact with the abdominal wall and diaphragmatic
vault, while the surface originally directed dorsad toward the stomach finally in large part
has an inclination caudad forming the &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; surface of human anatomy.</p></div>
